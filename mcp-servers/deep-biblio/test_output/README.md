# LaTeX Document Compilation Instructions

This document was generated from Markdown using deep-biblio-tools on 2025-10-25.

## Requirements

- LaTeX distribution (TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX)
- XeLaTeX compiler
- Biber for bibliography processing

## Compilation

### Using Make

If you have `make` installed:

```bash
make
```

To clean auxiliary files:

```bash
make clean
```

To remove all generated files including PDF:

```bash
make distclean
```

### Manual Compilation

If you don't have `make`, run these commands:

```bash
xelatex main
biber main
xelatex main
xelatex main
```

## Files

- `main.tex` - The main LaTeX document
- `references.bib` - Bibliography file
- `Makefile` - Build automation

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing packages**: Install required LaTeX packages using your distribution's package manager
2. **Bibliography not showing**: Make sure to run biber after the first xelatex compilation
3. **Encoding issues**: The document uses UTF-8 encoding

1. Compile the document locally to ensure it works
2. Create a ZIP file with all necessary files (`.tex`, `.bib`, any figures)
