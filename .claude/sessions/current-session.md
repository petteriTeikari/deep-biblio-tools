# Current Session: Deep Biblio Tools

**Started**: 2025-07-28 21:12:10
**Project**: Deep Biblio Tools
**Type**: library
**Language**: python

## Current Context

**What we're working on**: Code migration from legacy repository and test validation

**Progress so far** (2025-07-28):
- [OK] Generated project structure with Claude Code Guardrails
- [OK] Set up development environment
- [OK] Migrated functional code from ../biblioTools_old repository
- [OK] Created utils modules (extractors, validators, pdf_parser, content_classifier, workarounds)
- [OK] Migrated core BiblioChecker class with 983 lines of sophisticated bibliographic validation logic
- [OK] Created FastAPI endpoints for REST API functionality
- [OK] Updated dependencies in pyproject.toml with bibliographic libraries
- [OK] Fixed all linting errors (E722 bare except, F841 unused variables, syntax errors)
- [OK] Updated and ran all tests successfully (9/9 passing)
- [OK] Applied ruff formatting and code quality checks

**Critical Issues Discovered in Migration**:
- GitHub Actions failed due to missing `.claude/auto-context.yaml`
- Dependency group mismatch (`test` vs `dev`) in CI workflows
- Python version incompatibility between uv.lock (3.13) and Docker (3.12)
- Docker virtual environment portability issues with uv absolute paths
- Missing FastAPI application entry point

**Fixes Applied**:
- Created missing auto-context.yaml file
- Added `test` dependency group to pyproject.toml
- Added `requires-python = ">=3.12"` field
- Regenerated uv.lock with correct Python version
- Created main.py FastAPI entry point
- Updated Dockerfile for uv compatibility

**Additional Issues Discovered & Fixed**:
- Missing `python-multipart` dependency for FastAPI file uploads
- Double API route prefix issue (`/api/v1/api/v1/...`)
- Docker virtual environment installation strategy needed refinement

**Final Status**:
- ✅ All tests passing (9/9)
- ✅ Code quality checks clean (ruff)
- ✅ FastAPI application running successfully
- ✅ Docker container builds and runs properly
- ✅ API endpoints working correctly
- ✅ Comprehensive migration learnings documented

**Migration Success**: Successfully migrated sophisticated bibliographic validation tools from legacy codebase to modern Claude Guardrails template with full functionality preserved.

**Template Improvements Needed**: 8 critical issues identified that must be fixed in the cookiecutter template for future migrations.

## Session Continuity for Claude

Hi Claude! This is a continuation of our work on Deep Biblio Tools.

**Project Context**:
- **Type**: library project
- **Language**: python
- **Description**: Post-processing of LLM artifacts for scientific text

**Established Patterns**:
- Following the golden paths in `.claude/golden-paths.md`
- Using the behavior contract in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Maintaining session continuity through `.claude/sessions/`

**Current Focus**: Successfully migrated sophisticated bibliographic validation tools from legacy codebase, maintaining all functionality while adapting to modern FastAPI architecture. All tests passing, linting clean.

**Key Decisions Made**:
- Preserved all sophisticated features from original BiblioChecker (PDF parsing, workarounds for blocked publishers, content classification)
- Maintained academic domain detection and DOI validation capabilities
- Integrated with FastAPI for REST API access while keeping core logic intact
- Used modern Python 3.12+ type annotations throughout
- Fixed DOI extraction regex to avoid capturing trailing punctuation
- Chose to keep intentional bare except handlers for robustness in web scraping scenarios

**Known Constraints**:
- Follow project-specific constraints in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Maintain code quality standards
- Use established patterns from golden paths

Please help continue this work maintaining consistency with established patterns and decisions.
