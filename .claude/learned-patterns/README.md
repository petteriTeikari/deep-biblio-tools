# Learning Mechanisms System

This system captures and accumulates successful patterns from Claude interactions to improve future collaboration.

## Components

### Pattern Recognition
- **Successful Approaches**: Automatically identifies patterns that lead to positive outcomes
- **Anti-patterns**: Captures approaches that should be avoided
- **Context Matching**: Recognizes when similar situations occur

### Knowledge Accumulation
- **Pattern Library**: Structured storage of proven patterns
- **Continuous Learning**: Updates patterns based on new interactions
- **Pattern Validation**: Verifies effectiveness of patterns over time

## Usage

### View Current Patterns
```bash
python .claude/learned-patterns/pattern-manager.py --list
```

### Add New Pattern
```bash
python .claude/learned-patterns/pattern-manager.py --add-pattern \
  --category "debugging" \
  --context "fixing API errors" \
  --approach "systematic error reproduction" \
  --outcome "faster issue resolution"
```

## Integration

The learning system integrates with:
- Session Management (captures session outcomes)
- Trust Scoring (validates pattern effectiveness)
- Team Analytics (tracks learning velocity)
- Context Management (provides relevant patterns)
