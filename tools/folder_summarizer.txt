Could you next compile me an approximately 12-page academic literature reviw  of the .html and .md
   files in /home/petteri/Dropbox/LABs/KusiKasa/papers/scan2bim/biblio/scene_graphs using the
  original references in each of source documents, and putting them as hyperlinked inline citations
  to the generated Markdown document. Cover the history of 3D graphs for scene understamding, what
  are the knowledge gaps, what are the recent solutions (as talked by the documents, and proposed by
   the documents), and what are the future avenues. And if you could have a final chapter
  contextualizing the learnings for scan-to-bim solutions (see
  /home/petteri/Dropbox/LABs/KusiKasa/papers/scan2bim/md_context/scan-to-bim-journey-expanded.md).
  Do you have context length long enough, and can you compete the task at all? Remember the input
  files in pieces if they are longer than allowed max token limits. Maybe a good intermediate
  strategy is to first process all the files and save their summarized versions as markdown files
  with 25% of the original length, saving to disk as markdown files with _summary suffix and then
  doing the literature review from those _summary files on a second pass?

For example when looking at "3D_Dynamic_Scene_Graphs_summary.md" in                                 │
│   "/home/petteri/Dropbox/LABs/KusiKasa/papers/scan2bim/biblio/scene_graphs/summaries" the end result  │
│   is quite bad to be honest. Like I wanted the original citations from the paper so that I would      │
│   need the original paper anymore, preferably as hyperlinked linked citations in authoryear format.   │
│   For example instead of having "- SMPL model: [64]", you should have had "- SMPL model: ([Loper et   │
│   al. ](url?))" in markdown notation so that I know the name of the author from the cited paper and   │
│   preferably the hyperlink (but realize that this hyperlink would need some function calling as it    │
│   is not often available in the original html or markdown document :S So you could do a list of       │
│   references at the end of each summary: e.g. add "M. Loper, N. Mahmood, J. Romero, G. Pons-Moll,     │
│   and M. J. Black. SMPL: A skinned multi-person linear model.ACM Trans. Graphics (Proc. SIGGRAPH      │
│   Asia), 34(6):248:1–248:16, Oct. 2015." now to the end of the summary document. The compression      │
│   that you used was way too aggressive also, if you simply compare the filesizes of the output        │
│   summary (4.8 kB) and the input document (68.5 kB) that is hardly 25% of the original size? Could    │
│   you keep a lot more of the original input content. And you could you create some sort of            │
│   reproducible script of my request now with these fixes in the system prompt for Claude Code? As in  │
│   this will be now recurring task that I would like to create summaries from folders of papers and    │
│   I would not like everytime to write these instructions. I would simply like to run the script for   │
│   processing the folder? Could we redo this task and let's see how your revised summaries look like?  │
│   And I don't knwow where you saved the output review actually.

I did forget to mention that I would obviously want the academic hyperlinked inline citations to
  the final comprehensive literature review of all those 15 papers done, taking the original
  hyperlinked from the individual paper summaries. And preferably you would simply combine all the
  references from these invididual papers (and remove duplicates), so that after this process I would
   only need this one comprehensive review on these topic, and it would have all the cited literature
   from those papers. It does not seem to be the case now when I look at the .md file in review/, the
   individual paper summaries look excellent now and as how I wanted them to be
