# Summarization Improvements - Final Report

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. **Prompt Refinements**
- Changed from "EXACTLY X words" to more flexible enforcement with strong emphasis
- Added specific instructions to preserve citations in (Author, Year) format
- Emphasized preservation of Introduction, Related Work, and Future Work sections
- Added requirement for complete References section at the end
- Structured summary with specific word allocations for each section

### 2. **Compression Ratio Adjustments**
- Removed the 0.85x multiplier that was making compression too aggressive
- Now uses the target compression directly (25% = 25% of original)
- Added dynamic minimum word count based on original paper length
- For 25% compression: minimum is now 22% of original to ensure adequate coverage

### 3. **Citation and Reference Handling**
- Explicit instructions to extract EVERY citation from the paper
- Format: (Author, Year) with hyperlinks preserved as [Author (Year)](url)
- Focus on temporal tracking - years included for knowledge evolution
- Complete reference list required at end in standard academic format

### 4. **Focus Area Preservation**
- Introduction: 25% of summary (nearly verbatim preservation)
- Related Work: 20% of summary (all citations preserved)
- Methodology: 20% of summary (technical details maintained)
- Future Work: 4% of summary (keep verbatim)
- These sections now emphasized as "CRITICAL" with minimal compression

### 5. **Word Count Enforcement**
- Multiple reinforcements of target word count throughout prompt
- Final section specifically for word count enforcement
- Instructions on how to expand if running short (more methodology details, quotes, context)
- Target words displayed multiple times with emphasis

## Remaining Challenges

1. **AI Model Behavior**: The model tends to generate shorter summaries despite explicit instructions. This appears to be a limitation of the current Claude 3.5 Sonnet model's instruction following for exact word counts.

2. **Reference Extraction**: While the prompt asks for all references, the model sometimes abbreviates with "[Complete list of X references omitted for brevity]"

3. **Compression Targets**: Achieving exactly 20-25% compression is difficult - the model tends toward 10-20% compression despite instructions.

## Recommendations

1. **Use Temperature Setting**: Consider lowering temperature to 0.1 or 0.0 for more literal instruction following

2. **Few-Shot Examples**: Create 1-2 examples of properly formatted summaries with exact word counts and full references to guide the model

3. **Post-Processing**: Consider adding a verification step that checks word count and requests expansion if too short

4. **Alternative Models**: Test with GPT-4o or other models that may follow word count instructions more precisely

5. **Chunked Approach**: For very long papers, consider processing in chunks to ensure all content is captured

## Test Results Summary

| Paper | Target Words | Actual Words | Target % | Actual % | References |
|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|----------|------------|
| AirVista-II (HTML) | 1,911 | 926 | 25% | 12.1% | Partial |
| PDF Paper (Original) | 894 | 716 | 25% | 19.5% | Abbreviated |
| PDF Paper (Improved) | 894 | 728 | 25% | 19.9% | Abbreviated |

The improvements show progress but the fundamental challenge of getting the AI to generate longer summaries persists.
