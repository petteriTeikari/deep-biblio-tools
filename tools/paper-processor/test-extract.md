### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1. General overview

The AECindustryhas increasingly utilized building information modeling (BIM) since the early 2000s as a transformative technology to facilitate the design andconstruction process[1,2]. BIM integration could begin from the early design stage, during preconstruction services, or construction operations [3]. Recent software advancements have enabled BIM to handle more tasks than previously. In the construction industry, BIM models commonly serve as the primary tools for visualization andconstructabilityanalysis, actively mitigating potential risks during the construction phase [4]. Furthermore, the industry has already begun to utilize BIM beyond being just a 3D modeling tool, particularly within larger firms. The multi-dimensional aspects of BIM can extend to seven dimensions: 4D to planning or scheduling, 5D to cost, 6D tosustainability, and 7D to facility management [5,6].

]. Furthermore, the industry has already begun to utilize BIM beyond being just a 3D modeling tool, particularly within larger firms. The multi-dimensional aspects of BIM can extend to seven dimensions: 4D to planning or scheduling, 5D to cost, 6D tosustainability, and 7D to facility management [
Estimating plays a crucial role in every construction project, as it is instrumental in determining the budget throughout various phases, commencing from the early design stage and extending to the final project budget [7]. An accurate and detailed estimate becomes pivotal for securing the bid at a specific project stage, particularly in traditional delivery methods. Additionally, alternative delivery methods such as Design-Build and CM at Risk necessitate preconstruction services, including estimates, during the early design phase and throughout the construction lifecycle. Accurately preparing a Bill of Quantity (BoQ) is crucial for obtaining a precise and comprehensive estimate [8]. This process of material quantification is mostly called Quantity Take-off (QTO) or Quantity Surveying (QS) [9]. Furthermore, the QTO task is predominantly linked with 2D construction drawings and specifications, making it labor and time-intensive, posing a substantial challenge for the industry [10].
A survey conducted among 186 American Society of Professional Estimators members in 2021 revealed that most professionals rely on 2D software to prepare BoQ. Surprisingly, the survey also highlighted that most respondents do not use BIM widely for QTO tasks [7]. However, there is a significant potential for using BIM for QTO tasks, especially for simple building elements with basic geometry features with less complication, making them easy to take off like concrete and steel [4]. Recent studies showed that the awareness of BIM to be included in the QTO process is increasing rapidly [11,12]. Additionally, there is disagreement among professionals about what is beyond the 3 Dimensions of BIM, precisely the 5th Dimension, which is mainly related to cost [5]. One of the industry's challenges in this transition is primarily the time required to generate the 3D model and the software complexity [13].
One of the confusion aspects of the industry transition from 2D QTO to BIM-based QTO is the related information requirements on the BIM model to be quantifiable and complete to generate an accurate BoQ [14]. This type of BIM functions has led to the introduction of standardized terms for BIM models based on the Level of Development (LOD). These levels range from LOD 100, which represents the schematic design, to LOD 500, which encompasses the as-built documentation for Facility Management (FM) purposes [15]. BIM-based QTO in the early design stage could be very helpful for all the stakeholders as it has the potential to provide initial estimates even with a low LOD. One of the benefits of engaging BIM-based QTO is to improve the reliability of estimation and constructability analysis [16].
It is essential to clarify the standard terms used in this review. QTO and QS are regarded as synonymous tasks aimed at generating a Bill of Quantities (BoQ). Thequantity surveyorand estimator professions serve the same purpose and share many skills, tasks, and responsibilities. However, the estimator profession is more widely recognized in the United States, represented by the American Society of Professional Estimators (ASPE) and the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering (AACE). On the other hand, the Quantity Surveyor is more commonly used in other countries, such as the UK, where they are represented by the Royal Institution of CharteredSurveyors(RICS) [17].

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) in 2023, “cost estimators collect and analyze data to assess the time, money, materials, and labor required to produce a product or provide a service.” Typically, estimators are required to have a bachelor's degree in a related field, although experienced individuals from other occupations may qualify without a degree. In addition to essential qualities such as analytical, mathematical, andtime managementskills, most estimators undergo on-the-job training in software and techniques. This training may include BIM, Computer-Aided Design (CAD), or otherestimating software. It's important to note that the employment outlook for cost estimators shows a projected decline of 3% in the future. This decline is primarily attributed to advancements in software development, which are expected to significantly enhance the efficiency and productivity of estimators [18].

As an initial step, preliminary searches were undertaken to identify and refine the list of keywords for the study. The initial set of keywords included relevant terms such as estimate, quantity take-off, quantity surveying, bill of quantity, BIM, 5D BIM, and material quantification. The initial literature retrieval was performed using the Scopus® Database, which returned 278 records. Subsequently, using the PageRank algorithm [22], the keywords with the highest rank were chosen to be utilized to refine the keyword set further, based solely on the author's keywords. Finally, a list of keywords was identified to be highly relevant to the context of the review. The final keywords that have been used in this review for literature retrieval from both databases were as follows: “(bim OR building AND information AND modeling) AND (qto OR quantity AND take AND off) OR (qs OR quantity AND surveying)”. The queries were based on the search fields of the title, abstract, and authors' keywords.
The limits that have been applied to the search strategy of each database are described as follows: in the Scopus ® database, the subject area was chosen to be limited to Engineering, the language was limited to English, the publication type was limited to an article and the end date was set to be 2024. Based on these eligibility criteria, a total of 76 articles were returned from Scopus® database. On the other hand, the Web of Science ® category was limited to Construction Building Technology, the language was limited to English, the publication type was limited to article, and the end date was set to be 2024. Based on this eligibility criteria, a total of 162 articles were returned from the Web of Science® Database. The total number of returned articles from both databases was 238, ranging from 1995 to 2025 (Fig. 3).

#### 2.3. Screening process

##### 2.3.1. Initial screening (title and abstract)

The screening process anddata storagewere managed using the Covidence® platform. Covidence® is an online platform that helps researchers undergo screening while conducting a systematic literature review [23]. Starting with removing duplicates, 24 articles were identified and subsequently removed by the Covidence platform, with a manual verification by the authors. The total number of articles then decreased from 238 to 214, which were ready for initial screening. The initial screening was focused on how relevant the title and abstract of each record were to the research aim and objectives, considering the inclusion criteria based on the study characteristics as follows: research method, population group, and outcomes, as shown inFig. 4. It's worth noting that an active machine learning tool, developed by EPPI-Centre®, was used to prioritize the initial screening. This tool continually re-orders the articles based on past screening behavior [23]. A total of 139 records were irrelevant to the subject area, such as “How to develop a BIM-workflow for landscape architecture: A practical approach” [24] and “Excavation Safety Modeling Approach Using BIM and VPL” [25]. Other articles were removed in this phase due to the irrelevancy of the research theme, such as “As builtcase studiesfor BIM as conflicts detection and documentation tool” [26]. Of the remaining records, 75 were eligible to proceed to the following screening phase, a full-text review.Download:Download high-res image (175KB)Download:Download full-size imageFig. 4.

##### 2.3.2. Final screening (full text review)

The final screening process was carried out on the remaining 75 articles. This screening process involves a comprehensive full-text review of each record. This step was crucial for conducting a detailed assessment of the relevant articles to determine which records fully meet the inclusion criteria. It was also vital for creating a data extraction plan. Furthermore, this phase was also considered an essential step in building the structure of the data categories by identifying the research theme of each record for the data extraction plan. A total of 23 articles were excluded due to their irrelevant focus in the study, such as “Bim Structural Project Applied in A Case Study: Interoperability Analyses, Reinforcement Detailing Drawings and Quantity Take-Off” [27]. The primary focus of this study is to analyze the degree of interoperability verified in the development of the whole process of structural BIM. However, no significant development or aspects were investigated regarding Bim-based QTO. Another example, “Scan-To-Bim Technique in Building Maintenance Projects: Practicing Quantity Take-Off” [28] was also excluded. The reason for exclusion was that the focus of the study is more on the Scan-to-BIM process and object recognition than on material quantification using BIM.

The final screening process was carried out on the remaining 75 articles. This screening process involves a comprehensive full-text review of each record. This step was crucial for conducting a detailed assessment of the relevant articles to determine which records fully meet the inclusion criteria. It was also vital for creating a data extraction plan. Furthermore, this phase was also considered an essential step in building the structure of the data categories by identifying the research theme of each record for the data extraction plan. A total of 23 articles were excluded due to their irrelevant focus in the study, such as “Bim Structural Project Applied in A Case Study: Interoperability Analyses, Reinforcement Detailing Drawings and Quantity Take-Off” [27]. The primary focus of this study is to analyze the degree of interoperability verified in the development of the whole process of structural BIM. However, no significant development or aspects were investigated regarding Bim-based QTO. Another example, “Scan-To-Bim Technique in Building Maintenance Projects: Practicing Quantity Take-Off” [28] was also excluded. The reason for exclusion was that the focus of the study is more on the Scan-to-BIM process and object recognition than on material quantification using BIM. There were no significant developments in terms of BIM-based QTO in this study. The followingFig. 5details the PRISMA flow diagram of this review.

#### 2.4. Data extraction

Data extraction was performed manually by the authors, utilizing the reference manager software Zotero ® and Microsoft Excel ® for data storage formats. The information was primarily extracted from the abstract, keywords, methodology, results, and conclusions sections of each study, with the exclusion of the introduction and literature review sections, which typically reference studies beyond the scope of this review. This step also contributes to the bias management plan. The following (Table 1) provides the essential data that were extracted from the included studies, sorted by the year of publication, in order to carry out the meta-analysis through the summary of findings table [29]. Acronyms were included for a proper data presentation, and a legend below each table or figure will be provided, indicating the acronyms and their corresponding words.Table 1.

#### 3.2. Results of statistical synthesis of the benefits and challenges

The second objective of this review is to target the identification of the benefits and challenges of BIM in the context of QTO tasks. Specifically, the third category of the inclusion criteria requires that each article must include at least one benefit or challenge, allowing for the ranking of each based on their frequency in the records. Additionally, it will clarify any inconsistencies between the individual studies, considering the diverse nature of the studies from various perspectives of population groups' backgrounds and countries.
The 52 studies included in this analysis underwent three rounds of coding aimed at quantifying the results of each study. In the first round, relevant data regarding the benefits and challenges of the Bim-based QTO were extracted. To identify these benefits and challenges in each study's full text (excluding the introduction and literature review sections), a set of keywords—Benefits, Advantages, Features, Drivers, Challenges, Limitations, Barriers—was employed. These keywords were chosen to minimize bias risk and facilitate data extraction by highlighting them while examining the entire text. In the second round, qualitative coding was performed to establish categories from the interpretation of the data [76]. This step was crucial for standardizing the extracted data across the different studies, considering that each study used its terminologies. The categories were sorted as follows: cost, time, accuracy, management, skills, and software.
Each category corresponds to its own subcategories in a general way. For instance, thecost categoryis associated with the cost of technology implementation,return on investment, and project budget. The time category is related to the productivity of the material quantification process, change orders, early design estimates, and project schedules. The accuracy category discusses the margin of error, data reliability, and assumptions. The skills category is related to the personnel skills of the professionals to manipulate the data in the context of BIM for material quantification. The software category is related todata security, LOD, data complexity, and software capabilities. Lastly, the management category includes communications, collaborations, legal directions, regulations, cultures, conflicts, and multidisciplinary integrations. The third round involved matching the standardized categories and subcategories with the extracted data from the records. The subsequent sections delve into the detailed analysis results, organized by benefits and challenges, and further categorized by each specific category.

##### 3.2.1. BIM-based QTO benefits

Based on the coding and the analysis results of the included records, four categories of benefits were identified, referring to the specific area of impact on the QTO process. Then, these categories were sorted based on the frequency of appearance on the records as follows: Management-related benefits, time-related benefits, accuracy-related benefits, and cost-related benefits.Table 3shows the frequency of each benefit over time, color-coded by the corresponding category and sorted from the most to the least frequency.Table 3.

Table 3. BIM-Based QTO Benefits Frequency.
The top five subcategories of benefits that frequently appeared on the records are enhanced accuracy and completeness, productivity improvements, speed up the early estimates, and the ability to update simultaneously with design changes, respectively. These benefits have a significant impact, with a 33% frequency among all the 34 identified benefits. The quantitative results indicate a consensus among the included studies that the utilization of BIM-Based QTO enhances the accuracy and completeness of estimates, with a 10% frequency ranking as the highest among all other benefits. Additionally, productivity improvement was ranked as the second-highest benefit, with a frequency of 9%. The productivity improvement associated with leveraging BIM-Based QTO might be a contributing factor to the declining demand for the cost estimator profession [18].

##### 3.2.2. BIM-based QTO challenges

Regarding challenges, four categories were identified based on the specific area of impact of BIM-based QTO adoption. These categories have been sorted based on the frequency of appearance on the records as follows: Skills-related challenges, management-related challenges, software-related challenges, and cost-related challenges. The top five subcategories of challenges that frequently appeared on the records, with a frequency of nine or more, are limited BIM skills for estimators/quantity surveyors, lack of standard modeling techniques/approach, cultural challenges, and professionals' resistance, risk of losing data throughdata exchangeto different formats, and the cost of upskilling and training respectively. These challenges have a significant impact, with a 41% frequency among all the 29 identified challenges.Table 4shows the frequency of each challenge over time, color-coded by the corresponding category and sorted from the most to the least frequency.Table 4.

The results indicate that there is significant agreement on the lack of skills-related challenges as it shows the highest frequency among all other categories, with 32%. Furthermore, the highest frequency of the subcategories are the limited BIM skills for estimators/quantity surveyors and the lack of standard modeling techniques/approaches, with a total of 19 and 17 records that have addressed these challenges, respectively. These two challenges have a significant impact comparable to the frequency mean value of all challenges, which is 5.4 and has a median of 5.

##### 3.2.3. Results of investigations into heterogeneity

A comparative analysis has been conducted between the benefits and challenges of leveraging the BIM-based QTO approach. The first level of this analysis was based on the main categories. It has been found that two categories from the challenges and the corresponding categories from the benefits have potential inconsistencies.Table 5shows the number of occurrences for each of the benefits and challenges to their corresponding categories.Table 5. Temporal Analysis of Corresponding Challenges vs Benefits Categories.

Table 5. Temporal Analysis of Corresponding Challenges vs Benefits Categories.
The first set includes the management-related categories (CC1 vs BB1). The data shows an agreement between the records that the benefits are more prevalent than the challenges in the cost-related categories. The challenges include several cost category items, such as the high cost of technology implementation [49]. Additionally, the cost of infrastructure that this technology needs could be a serious issue, especially for micro and small companies [61,70]. Furthermore, several studies have addressed the low demand from clients to use the BIM approach for QTO tasks as a challenge, keeping this approach in a slow adoption pattern due to a lack of client financial support. They claim that there is a lack of knowledge among stakeholders, including clients, regarding how the completed BIM model could benefit them for facility management,Life Cycle Costing(LCC), and Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) [43,65].

The second set presents the management-related categories of the BIM-based QTO approach. The results show a significant development in this category, with high frequent agreement on both benefits and challenges, with a total of 62 and 48 co-occurrences in the included records, respectively, as shown inFig. 12that there are two waves of research production over time have addressed these issues, around 2015 and 2021 respectively. The key benefit of this category is the ability of the BIM model to be updated simultaneously with design changes, resulting in a reduction of time and resources needed to generate an estimate for any change order during the construction phase. Similarly, it applies to any changes in design and addenda during the preconstruction phase. This capability allows the client to explore different design alternatives associated with costs in a timely manner with minimal effort [34,53]. Additionally, these automated tasks to provide immediate feedback could significantly improve the quality of decision-making by avoiding wasting time andmaking design decisionsbased on early updated estimates, also known as data-driven decision-making [34,63,77].Download:Download high-res image (133KB)Download:Download full-size imageFig. 12.

The second level of the comparative analysis was centered on the specific subcategories of challenges and their corresponding benefits, as illustrated inFig. 12. The initial set of challenges pertained to human errors, specifically those occurring between C06 and B05. BIM models, being created by humans, are also susceptible to errors during the data entry and geometry modeling phases [68]. These errors, if present, can have a serious effect onsemantic information, consequently impacting the accuracy of automatic quantity schedules and leading to incorrect estimates. This raises concerns about the overall reliability and integrity of the BIM Model [36,58]. Conversely, there is a consensus on the potential reduction of human errors by leveraging the BIM-Based QTO approach. Recent studies highlight the improvements of the developed BIM tools in verifying the completeness and correctness of BIM models based on both geometry and semantic rules [14]. Visualizing building components within the BIM environment is also recognized as a means to enhance the accuracy of estimates [64].
]. These errors, if present, can have a serious effect onsemantic information, consequently impacting the accuracy of automatic quantity schedules and leading to incorrect estimates. This raises concerns about the overall reliability and integrity of the BIM Model [
The results indicate that the risk of data loss could pose a critical challenge, preventing the industry's adoption. During certain phases, data may need to be transmitted and extracted into different formats, exposing it to the potential loss of semantic data during this exchange formatting process [14,44]. Additionally, various modeling methods and approaches may introduce the risk of unintended information errors. The International Foundation Class (IFC) format remains limited in incorporating necessary information for the BIM-Based Quantity Takeoff (QTO) approach [33], raising concerns about the low interoperability between BIM models and estimation software [12,38,64,70].
Database management has opposing opinions among researchers, depending on the context of the database's uses. Most of the addressed challenges revolve around the lack of a database history, which could prevent and complicate the utilization of BIM-based QTO in LCC and LCA applications. This is noteworthy, given the potential of these applications to not only enhance the effectiveness of 5D BIM during the preconstruction and construction phases but also to contribute significantly to post-construction utilization, particularly in facility management [10,43]. Conversely, there are numerous benefits associated with improving databases through the utilization of BIM. This improvement aims to reduce the loss of information through a reliable BIM database [11,60]. By employing a BIM-based QTO approach, the LCC database will correspondingly improve over time [54]. This enhancement also aids in storing assets in digital formats with pertinent information, thus serving as a significant factor in effective asset management.
The last set of inconsistencies analysis focuses on the collaboration and communication aspects of utilizing a BIM-Based approach. Theabsenceof collaboration among industry experts can pose challenges, as each firm develops its approach independently without standardized modeling techniques and a transparent information entry approach, resulting in incomplete experiences that may be suitable for one project but not for another [46,49]. Furthermore, due to the complexity of BIM software, inefficient exchange and sharing of information within the project team can create a poor communication environment [39,65]. On the positive side, this approach has the potential to enhance communication among the project team and designers by facilitating access to information for the entire project team [11,38]. This easy access to information can also keep other project stakeholders informed and aware of the project budget, thereby reducing information errors and providing early warnings for potential issues [39,54].

#### 3.3. Gaps and future opportunities

This section is focused on addressing the third objective of this review, which aims to identify evidence-based research gaps related to the primary challenges, inconsistencies, and less discussed frequently benefits. Additionally, future recommendations and a research agenda proposal will be presented based on the records' suggestions as future recommendations.

##### 3.3.1. Gap analysis

This review has assessed the challenges and benefits of leveraging the BIM-Based QTO approach to identify the gaps related to the research and development. These gaps were sorted into three categories based on the focus area of research as follows: professional skills, software developments, and the translation procedure of standards and codes into BIM cost-related data.
Challenges associated with professional skills were identified as the foremost barrier to the widespread adoption of BIM in material quantification practices. Despite 19 included studies recognizing this challenge, none have specifically delved into formulating solutions or investing efforts to address this concern for experienced construction professionals, entry-levelquantity surveyors, and estimators. Additionally, there is a lack of investigations aimed at upskilling seasoned employees to acquire the essential required competencies to align with the emerging approach of BIM-based QTO currently available in the market.
The software development gaps can be classified into two closely interlinked categories:Application Programming Interface(API) development and Modeling and Data Entry Strategies. The first category includes gaps that are closely tied to the development ofsoftware tools, primarily aimed at software developers. This is intended to address the deficiency of user-friendly interfaces in various BIM software options, particularly in the areas of costing and material quantification tools. The second category of gaps targets construction management experts who possess knowledge in the QTO and estimating practices. Additionally, there are no significant developments in the modeling standards, frameworks, and rules to establish best practices. This gap aims to standardize and streamline processes across various projects systematically, addressing the current lack of uniformity in the industry.

The translation procedure of standards and codes into BIM cost-related data represents a significant gap that researchers are working to address. While a few studies have addressed this topic and proposedNatural Language Processing(NLP) approaches and other frameworks to resolve the issue, these solutions are not yet mature enough for experimentation on real-world projects or practical implementation. It is recognized that the gap between NLP in computer science and its applications in construction is gradually narrowing over time [78]. Therefore, initiating experimental research throughcase studiesis essential to demonstrate the efficiency of the actual implementations of these algorithms and frameworks.

##### 3.3.2. Future research agenda proposal

The adoption of the Bim-based QTO approach stillfacesnumerous challenges and limitations in its implementation within quantity surveying firms and construction firms that perform in-house QTO. Adopting the BIM approach is crucial for the long-term survival of these firms [37]. Four studies highlight the limited research on this topic as a significant challenge, emphasizing the need for further exploration through related searches [11,12,66,69]. The future recommendations from the included studies have been analyzed and categorized based on the area of interest within the research topic of Bim-based QTO.Table 6addresses the future research opportunities in the field of BIM-based QTO research and development.Table 6.

The results shown inFig. 7highlight the predominant trends addressed in the related literature, namely Education, Upskilling, Limitations, Barriers, and Challenges. This suggests a strong relationship between the lack of BIM-based QTO implementation and these identified trends. Additionally,Fig. 8illustrates the temporal analysis of these trends, revealing a continuous increase over time, emphasizing the sustained demand for these topics. Among the various trends, upskilling and education emerge as the most prominent, with the highest cumulative occurrence. Even though 19 studies have recognized this challenge, none of them have focused specifically on formulating solutions or investing efforts to address the concerns of experienced construction professionals. This observation is closely linked to the primary andrecurrentchallenges hindering the industry's adoption and full implementation of BIM-based QTO. These challenges are attributed to professionals lacking the necessary skills and placing high expectations on the competencies of graduates [42,62,72].

Focusing on the most prevalent benefits and challenges, it becomes evident that the researchers expressed their interest in incorporating BIM into estimating and material quantification practices as early as 2007. They sought to explore the associated challenges and benefits of this innovative approach. The trend gained more popularity in 2014 when the topic began to get more attention among researchers, who started to gather insights from industry professionals about their experiences with BIM-based QTO in their work.Table 7illustrates the evolving perspective, highlighting the top 5 benefits and the top 5 challenges from 2007 through the end of 2023.Table 7.

Initially, the focus was more on the benefits, but after 2019, with increased adoption by industry professionals, the challenges started to grow, mainly related to the skills of professionals to keep pace with this revolutionary shift. Skill-related challenges were compounded by theabsenceof standardized modeling techniques and approaches, leading professionals to adopt a project-by-project method basis. As of the close of 2023, a significant shift was observed; attention to benefits has decreased, and more challenges have shown up in response to the industry demands.

#### 4.1. Implications of the results for practice

However, the targeted population for this topic, those who are directly engaging in these issues, comprises seasoned professionals in preconstruction management, primarily Estimators and Quantity Surveyors [58]. Additionally, construction management and quantity surveying students from higher education institutions also play a significant role in this adoption [42,46]. Each of these two population groups is involved in distinct experiences to maintain and enhance their skills. Concerning the main findings of this meta-analysis of the existing literature, this research suggests the following conceptual model for Bim-based QTO implementation (Fig. 13), aimed at integrating academia, industry, andprofessional trainingagencies to effectively manage their contributions towards this approach to achieve a fully sustainable engagement.Download:Download high-res image (416KB)Download:Download full-size imageFig. 13.

The model begins by targeting two specific population groups: Seasoned Professionals and CM/QS Students. It then establishes a connection between these groups and their respective skill sources to gain a comprehensive understanding of material quantification using BIM. The process starts with Seasoned Professionals undergoing upskilling training, gradually immersing themselves in BIM practices. This gradual engagement is crucial for overcoming cultural resistance, a challenge identified in various studies [49,69]. On the other hand, CM/QS students enhance their BIM skills throughout their learning journey, following an updated curriculum aimed towards the adoption of BIM for QTO. However, these curriculum developments may not be sufficient at the time to produce graduates with full BIM competencies for the industry. Consequently, entry-level employees, as is customary, may require additional advanced BIM training, which could be facilitated by seasoned professionals or training agencies.
Once the professional begins utilizing the available tools offered on the market, more detailed feedback regarding theAPIcould be collected through the research process, including publications related to software development and improvement approaches based on the experiences of various experts. This step has the potential to contribute to solving issues related to software complexity and the lack of collaboration among industry experts [49]. The developments in these APIs would, in turn, be integrated into Upskilling training for further improvements. The fundamental concept of connecting professionals in a continuous loop of development alongside other experts, developers, researchers, and academia will gradually enhance the adoption of this approach [46]. The goal is to achieve a competent system of APIs and approaches, ultimately integrating 5D BIM seamlessly into the QTO and estimating processes.

While utilizing BIM-based QTO, the opportunity to generate a database would be beneficial to avoid discarding data once the project is completed. Creating a historical database based on project specifications would enable the development of object family libraries that can be retained in-house for future use. These libraries can then be utilized to streamline the quantification process for future projects. The database's historical records can also contribute toLife Cycle Costing(LCC) andLife Cycle Assessment(LCA), providing reliable data for various stakeholders [43,50,58]. This information becomes valuable for applications such as facility management on the owner's side and sustainability considerations for the design and construction teams. This sustainable advancement loop remains live and continually updated with each additional project, leading to outcomes that benefit all involved parties.

Natural Language Processing(NLP) would play a significant role inAPIdevelopment. NLP's contribution lies in facilitating the translation of project information into 5D BIM data, providing richsemantic informationthat can be utilized for material quantifications and other BIM features [14]. Additionally, it is closely linked to the Standard Method of Measurement (SMM) utilization in the context of BIM-based QTO [47]. This facilitation involves live-link with machine learning models, referencing both pre-trained models and historical databases generated through the utilization of BIM-based QTO by time [10]. The training model sequence can autonomously retrain itself, enhancing its contributions to API systems over time.

### 5. Conclusions

This paper explores the benefits, challenges, and future opportunities of the BIM-Based QTO approach through bibliometric analysis of relevant publications. The study employed the PRISMA method to identify relevant literature, initially screening 238 journal articles and selecting 52 articles from Scopus® and Web of Science® databases based on inclusion criteria. The selected articles underwent a comprehensive review to formulate a conceptual implementation model for BIM-Based QTO. Utilizing the investigations of the Heterogeneity method on the statistical synthesis of the included studies, the study identified critical gaps in skills-related aspects, software functionality, data entry strategies, and translation procedures for standards and codes.
The primary findings suggest that current prevalent trends in the field of BIM-based QTO implementation techniques and professional upskilling. The most significant challenge in adopting this approach is the limited professional skills in BIM. Furthermore, the BIM-based QTO approach has been shown to improve the productivity, accuracy, and completeness of cost-estimating tasks. BIM databases can potentially benefit 5D BIM practices, API developments, LCC, and LCA. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is closely associated with the 5D BIM revolution.
Future research opportunities have been identified to fill the research gaps within several areas of interest associated with the BIM-based QTO approach. These areas include construction management, collaboration and communication, software development, databases, algorithms, academic research opportunities, and upskilling training for seasoned professionals. Subsequently, a conceptual model for BIM-based QTO implementation has been developed, aligning with the proposed future research objectives, with the intention of combining the contributions of the existing literature findings into a unified framework. The aim of this model is to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable integration with the BIM-based QTO approach.
Although numerous review articles have been published about BIM, they vary in their focus. Some examine the level of agreement on the different dimensions of BIM among existing literature including the fifth dimension which is related to cost [5]. The agreement level drops in higher dimensions, suggesting limited BIM implementation in specific fields. While other reviews highlight the application ofIoTin conjunction with BIM [19] or the use ofdigital twintechnology [79]. The concept of digital twins is commonly employed in the realm of facility management and maintenance applications. In this context, the quantity of materials plays a crucial role, especially when it comes to maintenance and life cycle assessments. Additionally, some reviews explore the level of adoption of BIM within the industry [80]. They highlight different aspects of BIM applications, including BIM-based QTO which has great potential to be implemented in the industry. This systematic review examines the current state of utilization of BIM-based QTO among quantity surveyors and estimators. The review identifies the main benefits of this approach as enhancing the completeness, accuracy, and productivity of the QTO task. However, the review also highlights challenges, such as the need to formulate solutions and invest efforts to address the skill set concerns of experienced construction professionals, entry-level quantity surveyors, and estimators.

The major contribution of this review study to the body of knowledge is to offer a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and challenges associated with the BIM-based QTO approach. This was achieved by transforming the qualitative findings from 52 relevant journal articles into a standardized format. It is important to note that this review focused specifically on journal articles closely aligned with the topic of BIM-based QTO. A more extensive review is recommended to include conference papers that were excluded because they are beyond the scope of this review. This broader scope would facilitate a more comprehensive identification of BIM-based QTO benefits and challenges and allow additional experts' experience to be incorporated.

#### The role of polyvinyl chloride in achieving circularity in the built environment: A comprehensive review

The role of polyvinyl chloride in achieving circularity in the built environment: A comprehensive review
The role of polyvinyl chloride in achieving circularity in the built environment: A comprehensive review
2026, Environmental Impact Assessment Review
The world is struggling with the enormous challenge of managing Plastic Waste (PW), which is over 400 million tonnes (Mt) annually and is the world's largest and most rapidly accumulating waste stream. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a versatile synthetic polymer, is the third most sold commodity plastic used in various industries. To promote sustainable development and implement the Circular Economy (CE) concepts, reuse, recycling, and remanufacturing have become priorities for PVC circularity. This research study examines the current trends in PVC circularity and gaps for future research directions in connecting Waste Management (WM) to achieve CE practices. Hence, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was undertaken, and two databases, namely Scopus and Web of Science, were used. The findings from the systematic literature review show that PVC circularity research has advanced significantly in recent years, with an emphasis on chemical and mechanical recycling as well as the creation of novel methods to improve material recovery and lower toxicity. However, gaps remain in circularity-directed research and in exploring efficient recycling processes for PVC waste. Addressing these challenges will require concerted efforts to improve stakeholder collaboration, build better communication channels, and invest in infrastructure supporting circular practices. By strengthening these areas, the PVC can make significant progress toward enhancing circularity, reducing environmental impact, and contributing to broader sustainability goals. The findings suggest prioritising effective recycling methods, material flow analysis, and policy frameworks to facilitate PVC's transition to a CE, consequently minimising environmental impact and resource dependency.

Research on wearable sensing devices (WSDs) in construction has increased significantly in recent years due to their demonstrated capability to enhance worker safety through real-time monitoring. However, existing literature lacks a critical assessment of their current applications, implementation challenges, and developmental opportunities. To address this gap, a systematic review was conducted, which included bibliometric and content analyses of 107 and 92 studies published between 2010 and 2024, respectively. The results reveal eight primary WSD application areas: health and fatigue monitoring, hazard identification, activity recognition, location tracking, fall detection, environmental sensing, communication and training. Four operational limitations, six adoption barriers, future research needs, and device development opportunities were identified and thoroughly discussed. A conceptual action framework was developed to outline the strategic roles and policy mechanisms necessary to support WSD implementation. This paper provides a consolidated foundation to guide future research and the effective use of WSDs to improve construction safety.

Accurate construction cost estimation is vital for ensuring profitable project execution for both owners and contractors. However, traditional methods often rely on disparate engineering data, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies among stakeholders. To address this, this paper introduces an automated system that semantically enriches Building Information Modeling (BIM) models by integrating Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) with interconnected data dictionaries. By automating the cost estimation procedure, the proposed system streamlines decision-making, demonstrating significant advantages over traditional project management frameworks in a real-world pumped-storage project during the preconstruction phase. The findings also highlight future research directions for incorporating real-time engineering quotas and fluctuating market prices to enhance construction practices.

2025, Automation in Construction
Design for reuse (DfR) is a key strategy for advancing sustainable construction, yet its adoption remains limited. A major gap is the lack of tools that incorporate topological assessments to support deconstruction and material reuse planning. Existing quantity takeoff (QTO) tools primarily focus on design and virgin material procurement stages, often overlooking the in-situ topology of materials and the realities of disassembly, resulting in inaccurate reuse estimates. To address this, a method is introduced that topologically evaluates structural components within as-built models, identifies connection types using enriched information, and anticipates component availability after deconstruction. Using the results of two institutional building projects, this framework is shown to more accurately estimate quantities of materials at their end of life, facilitating planning and decision-making for sustainable construction initiatives. The main contribution of this paper is the adaptation of conventional QTO practices to better support circular decision-making at the end-of-life stage of construction projects.
