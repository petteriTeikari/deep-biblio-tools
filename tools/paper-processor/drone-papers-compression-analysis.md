## Key Findings

### 1. **Compression Patterns**
- **Average Compression**: 7.5%
- **Overall Compression**: 4.9% (total summary words / total original words)
- **Range**: 1.6% to 18.9%

### 2. **Paper Length Impact**
- Shorter papers (3-8k words): Higher compression ratios (8-19%)
- Medium papers (10-20k words): Medium compression (3-6%)
- Longer papers (30k+ words): Very low compression (1-2%)

### 3. **Model Behavior**
Despite setting compression target to 0.60 (60%), the model consistently produces much shorter summaries:
- All summaries were between 514-699 words
- The model appears to have an internal "summary length ceiling" around 700 words
- Longer papers get more aggressively compressed

### 4. **Quality Observations**
The summaries maintain:
- Clear structure with sections
- Technical details and key metrics
- Citations in (Author, Year) format
- Core contributions and findings

## Recommendations

### For Optimal Results:
1. **For papers < 10k words**: Use compression setting 0.50-0.60
2. **For papers 10-20k words**: Use compression setting 0.70-0.80
3. **For papers > 20k words**: Consider section-based extraction instead

### Alternative Approaches:
1. **Section-based processing**: Extract introduction, methodology, and future work with minimal compression
2. **Multi-pass approach**: First extract, then summarize
3. **Hybrid method**: Use AI for structure, preserve key sections verbatim

## Conclusion

The model shows strong resistance to generating longer summaries, regardless of compression settings. While the summaries are high quality and preserve key information, they're consistently shorter than ideal for comprehensive research use. The sweet spot appears to be papers in the 5-10k word range, which achieve 8-10% compression with reasonable detail preservation.
