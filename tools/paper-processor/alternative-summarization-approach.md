# Alternative Summarization Approach

## The Challenge
Current AI models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus) consistently produce shorter summaries than requested, even with explicit word count instructions. The models tend to compress to 10-15% rather than the target 20-25%.

## Recommended Alternative Approach

### 1. **Section-Based Extraction**
Instead of asking for a single summary, process the paper in sections:
- Extract Introduction (preserve 90-95%)
- Extract Related Work (preserve 85-90%)
- Extract Methodology (compress to 50%)
- Extract Results (compress to 40%)
- Extract Future Work (preserve 95-100%)
- Extract all References (preserve 100%)

### 2. **Multi-Pass Processing**
- First pass: Extract and preserve key sections
- Second pass: Summarize less critical sections
- Third pass: Combine and ensure citations are properly formatted

### 3. **Template-Based Approach**
Create a template that forces preservation of key content:
```
PRESERVED INTRODUCTION:
[Near-verbatim introduction with all citations]

PRESERVED RELATED WORK:
[Complete related work section with all citations]

SUMMARIZED METHODOLOGY:
[Compressed methodology]

SUMMARIZED RESULTS:
[Key results only]

PRESERVED FUTURE WORK:
[Complete future work section]

COMPLETE REFERENCES:
[All references from original paper]
```

### 4. **Citation-First Approach**
1. First extract ALL citations and references
2. Then build summary ensuring every citation is used
3. This ensures no references are lost

### 5. **Hybrid Human-AI Approach**
For critical papers:
1. AI extracts and formats all citations/references
2. AI identifies key sections to preserve
3. Human reviews and adjusts compression levels
4. AI generates final formatted summary

## Implementation Suggestions

### Modify the AI Summarizer to:
1. Make multiple API calls for different sections
2. Use different prompts for different sections
3. Combine results programmatically
4. Verify citation completeness

### Example Section-Specific Prompts:
- **Introduction**: "Extract the complete introduction section, preserving all text and citations"
- **Related Work**: "Extract all citations and key comparisons from the related work section"
- **Future Work**: "Extract the complete future work or conclusion section verbatim"

This approach would likely achieve better preservation of critical content while still providing compression where appropriate.
