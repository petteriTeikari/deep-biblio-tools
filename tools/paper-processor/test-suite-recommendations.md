# Test Suite Recommendations for Academic Paper Rephrasing

Based on batch processing 51 papers, here are recommendations for a comprehensive test suite:

## 1. Input Validation Tests

### Character Encoding Tests
- **Unicode Characters**: Test with papers containing special Unicode symbols (➊, ➋, ➌, etc.)
  - Example failure: "LRR-Bench" paper failed with `invalid literal for int() with base 10: '➊'`
  - Solution: Handle Unicode in word counting or pre-clean

### File Format Tests
- **HTML to Markdown Conversion**: Test various HTML structures
  - Tables (currently not converting properly to markdown tables)
  - Nested lists
  - Complex citations with multiple layers of markup
  - Mathematical formulas and equations

## 2. Content Extraction Tests

### Reference Extraction
- **Various Reference Formats**:
  - Numbered lists: `[1] Author et al...`
  - Bullet lists: `- [Author et al. (Year)]...`
  - ArXiv-specific format with multiple markup layers
  - Mixed formats within same paper

- **Reference Boundaries**:
  - Ensure extraction stops before appendix content
  - Handle papers where references appear mid-document
  - Test with no references section

### Section Detection
- **Appendix Filtering**:
  - Test various appendix headers: "Appendix", "Supplementary", "Ablation Study"
  - Ensure processing stops at References section
  - Handle papers with non-standard section ordering

## 3. Retention Rate Tests

### Target vs Actual Retention
- **Range Validation**:
  - Target: 45%
  - Observed range: 15.5% - 66.8%
  - Average: 35%
  - Test papers with extreme length variations

### Content Preservation
- **Critical Sections**:
  - Future Work: Should be ~100% preserved
  - Limitations: Should be >95% preserved
  - Introduction/Conclusion: Higher preservation than methods

## 4. Output Quality Tests

### Formatting Tests
- **Markdown Structure**:
  - Proper header hierarchy
  - Clean paragraph breaks
  - No duplicate content
  - No HTML artifacts in output

### Bibliography Formatting
- **Reference List Quality**:
  - All references have author, year, title, venue
  - No truncated references
  - No appendix content mixed in
  - Proper numbering sequence

## 5. Edge Case Tests

### Paper Length Extremes
- **Very Short Papers** (<1000 words)
- **Very Long Papers** (>50,000 words)
- **Papers with Minimal Content Sections**

### Unusual Structures
- **Non-standard Section Names**
- **Papers Without Clear Structure**
- **Multiple Reference Sections**
- **Inline References Without Dedicated Section**

## 6. Performance Tests

### Batch Processing
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor with large batches
- **Error Recovery**: One failure shouldn't stop batch
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear status for each file
- **Parallel Processing**: If implemented

## 7. Business Logic Tests

### Research Gap Focus
- **Verify Preservation Priorities**:
  - Knowledge gaps emphasized over metrics
  - Business opportunities section included
  - Technical details minimized appropriately

### BIM/Scan-to-BIM Context
- **Context Integration**:
  - Relevant business opportunities generated
  - Construction-specific insights included
  - Generic enough for various paper topics

## 8. Regression Tests

### Known Good Outputs
- Keep a set of "golden" outputs for regression testing
- Test suite should verify:
  - No degradation in reference extraction
  - Consistent retention rates
  - Stable section detection

## 9. Error Handling Tests

### Graceful Degradation
- **Missing Sections**: Handle papers without abstract, conclusion, etc.
- **Malformed Input**: Corrupt markdown, incomplete HTML
- **Empty Content**: Sections with no meaningful content

## 10. Integration Tests

### Full Pipeline
- **HTML → Markdown → Rephrased**:
  - Test complete workflow
  - Verify no data loss between stages
  - Check final output quality

## Test Implementation Strategy

```python
class TestAcademicRephrasing:
    def test_unicode_handling(self):
        """Test papers with special Unicode characters."""

    def test_reference_extraction_formats(self):
        """Test various reference format extractions."""

    def test_retention_rate_accuracy(self):
        """Verify retention rates match targets."""

    def test_appendix_filtering(self):
        """Ensure appendix content is excluded."""

    def test_critical_section_preservation(self):
        """Verify future work and limitations preserved."""

    def test_batch_processing_resilience(self):
        """Test batch continues despite individual failures."""
```

## Metrics to Track

1. **Success Rate**: Currently 98% (50/51)
2. **Average Retention**: Currently 35% (target 45%)
3. **Processing Time**: Per paper and batch total
4. **Memory Usage**: Peak and average
5. **Quality Score**: Based on output validation

## Continuous Improvement

- Log all failures with full context
- Track retention rate distribution
- Monitor for new edge cases
- Update test suite with each new failure type
