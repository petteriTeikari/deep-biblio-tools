Title: BIM-based Quantity Takeoff: Current State and Future Opportunities
Authors: Shadi Alathamneh, Wesley Collins, Salman Azhar

This systematic review paper examines the current state, benefits, challenges, and future opportunities of Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based Quantity Takeoff (QTO) in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. The study employs the PRISMA method to analyze 52 selected journal articles from Scopus® and Web of Science® databases, providing a comprehensive assessment of BIM-based QTO implementation.

The paper addresses a critical gap in the literature, as despite the growing number of BIM-related publications, no systematic review had previously been conducted specifically on BIM-based QTO approaches. This research is particularly significant given the increasing adoption of BIM technology in the construction industry and its potential to revolutionize traditional quantity takeoff processes.

The key innovation of this work lies in its systematic approach to synthesizing existing knowledge and developing a conceptual model for implementing BIM-based QTO. Through bibliometric analysis, the study identifies critical aspects across multiple dimensions:

- Management practices and workflows
- Professional skill requirements and development needs
- Software functionality and technical capabilities
- Implementation costs and organizational barriers

The paper makes several important contributions:

1. Provides the first comprehensive systematic review of BIM-based QTO literature
2. Develops a conceptual framework for sustainable BIM-based QTO implementation
3. Identifies key research gaps and future opportunities in the field
4. Analyzes trends in adoption barriers and success factors
5. Examines the relationship between BIM-based QTO and emerging technologies

The authors employ a rigorous methodology combining:
- PRISMA systematic review guidelines
- Bibliometric analysis of publication trends
- Heterogeneity analysis of included studies
- Qualitative synthesis of findings
- Development of an implementation framework

This work is particularly timely given the construction industry's ongoing digital transformation and the growing importance of accurate quantity takeoff for project success. The findings have significant implications for practitioners, researchers, and educators in the AEC field, providing evidence-based insights to guide BIM-based QTO adoption and implementation strategies.
