## Appendix: Original Paper References

The following references were cited in the original AirVista-II paper. While specific bibliographic details were not provided in the extracted text, the numbered citations indicate the following research areas:

[1] **Embodied Intelligence and UAV Perception** - Referenced in the context of UAVs functioning as embodied intelligence platforms with semantic modeling capabilities.

[2-4] **Foundation Models and Large Language Models** - Three references discussing the application of Foundation Models (FMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in embodied intelligence, demonstrating autonomy and domain adaptability.

[5] **de Zarzà et al.** - Work on integrating multiple Foundation Models for UAV video understanding systems.

[6] **de Curtò et al.** - Research on Foundation Model integration for UAV video understanding, achieving progress in semantic modeling.

[7] **Generalization Limitations** - Reference discussing limitations in generalization when dealing with structurally complex and open-ended tasks.

[8] **Agentic AI Paradigm** - Reference on LLM-driven agentic artificial intelligence with capabilities including task decomposition, tool invocation, and multi-agent coordination.

[9] **UAV Semantic Understanding Framework** - Reference supporting the unified framework for UAV-performed semantic understanding tasks in dynamic scenes.

### Additional Dataset References

The paper utilized the following public datasets for evaluation:
- **ERA Dataset** - For aerial video understanding evaluation
