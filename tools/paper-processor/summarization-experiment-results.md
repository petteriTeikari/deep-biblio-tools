# Summarization Experiment Results

## Test 1: AirVista-II Paper (HTML)
- **Original length**: 7,645 words
- **Target compression**: 25% (should be ~1,911 words)
- **Actual summary**: 926 words (12.1% compression)
- **Issue**: Summary too short, missing full references

## Test 2: PDF Paper (2503.08302v1.pdf)
- **Original length**: 3,663 words
- **Target compression**: 30% (should be ~1,099 words)
- **Actual summary**: 716 words (19.5% compression)
- **Issue**: Close to target but still short, references abbreviated

## Key Issues Identified:
1. AI model generating shorter summaries than requested
2. References section abbreviated or missing
3. Not enough detail from focus sections (introduction, future work)
4. Need to preserve more content from key sections

## Next Steps:
- Analyze reference extraction from papers
- Create few-shot examples
- Refine prompt strategy
