# Retrospectives Documentation

This directory contains retrospective analyses, lessons learned, and reflections on the Deep Biblio Tools project development.

## 📊 Available Retrospectives

- **[Current State Analysis](current-state-analysis.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of the current codebase state and architecture
- **[LaTeX Bibliography Conversion Retrospective](latex-bibliography-conversion-retrospective.md)** - Lessons learned from implementing LaTeX bibliography conversion
- **[Self-Reflection and Broader Context](self-reflection-and-broader-context.md)** - Project reflections and broader implications

## 🎯 Purpose of Retrospectives

Retrospectives serve to:
1. **Document Lessons Learned** - Capture what worked well and what didn't
2. **Improve Future Development** - Apply insights to upcoming work
3. **Share Knowledge** - Help new contributors understand project evolution
4. **Track Progress** - Record how the project has evolved over time

## 📝 Creating New Retrospectives

When writing retrospectives:
- **Be Honest** - Document both successes and failures
- **Be Specific** - Include concrete examples and metrics
- **Focus on Learning** - Emphasize what can be improved
- **Include Context** - Explain the circumstances and constraints
- **Suggest Actions** - Propose specific improvements

## 🔍 Key Insights

### From Current Development
- Deterministic processing is crucial for LLM hallucination detection
- AST-based parsing prevents many common parsing errors
- Batch API processing significantly improves performance
- Comprehensive testing catches issues early

### From Past Challenges
- Script consolidation reduced maintenance burden
- Clear module boundaries improve code organization
- AI-assisted development requires careful guardrails
- Documentation is essential for project sustainability

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

Retrospectives should be conducted:
- After major feature implementations
- When significant refactoring is completed
- At regular intervals (quarterly recommended)
- When critical issues are resolved

Remember: The goal is continuous improvement, not blame or criticism.
