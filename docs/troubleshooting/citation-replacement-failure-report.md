# Citation Replacement Complete Failure - Urgent Investigation Required

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: üö® CRITICAL FAILURE - AST-Based Replacement NOT Working
**Severity**: P0 - Complete pipeline failure

---

## Executive Summary

The AST-based citation replacement implemented in Phase 3 is **NOT functioning**. Despite claims of success:

1. ‚úÖ Code was written and committed
2. ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks passed
3. ‚úÖ No syntax errors
4. ‚ùå **Citations are NOT being replaced in actual conversions**

**Evidence**: LaTeX output contains raw markdown citations like `[Chen et al. (2024)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~chen2086/)` instead of `\citep{key}` commands, causing BibTeX to fail with "I found no \citation commands".

---

## The Critical Discovery

### What We Claimed to Fix

Per `PHASE3-5-IMPLEMENTATION-REPORT.md`:
- Implemented `replace_citations_in_text_ast()` using markdown-it-py (lines 1193-1310)
- Created normalized URL lookup map (lines 1174-1191)
- Simplified `replace_citations_in_text()` wrapper (lines 1312-1317)
- Committed with message: "feat: Implement AST-based citation replacement using markdown-it-py"

### What Actually Happens

**Test conversion output** (`fashion-cad-review-v3.md` ‚Üí LaTeX):

```latex
% In abstract (line 61):
[Chen et al. (2024)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~chen2086/)

% In abstract (line 63):
[GarmentCode (Korosteleva & Sorkine-Hornung, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3618394)
[Design2GarmentCode (Zhou et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08603)
```

**Expected output**:
```latex
\citep{chen2024}
\citep{korosteleva2023sorkinehornunggarmentcode}
\citep{zhou2024design2garmentcode}
```

**BibTeX error**:
```
I found no \citation commands---while reading file fashion-cad-review-v3.aux
(There was 1 error message)
```

### Pipeline Evidence

The pipeline explicitly calls replacement at **converter.py:1141**:
```python
content = self.citation_manager.replace_citations_in_text(content)
```

This should invoke our new AST-based method, but **it's not working**.

---

## Root Cause Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Token Rendering Broken

The AST implementation extracts tokens and tries to render them back to text:

```python
# From citation_manager.py:1281-1296
output_parts = []
for token in tokens:
    if token.type == "text":
        output_parts.append(token.content)
    elif token.type == "inline" and token.children:
        for child in token.children:
            if child.type == "text":
                output_parts.append(child.content)
    elif hasattr(token, "content") and token.content:
        output_parts.append(token.content)

# If we didn't get good output, use renderer
if not output_parts or len("".join(output_parts).strip()) < len(content) // 2:
    output = md.renderer.render(tokens, md.options, {})
else:
    output = "".join(output_parts)
```

**Problem**: This manual token extraction is fragile and may not handle all markdown-it token types.

### Hypothesis 2: URL Lookup Fails

The URL normalization and lookup might fail silently:

```python
# From citation_manager.py:1234-1241
normalized_href = normalize_url(href)
key = url_to_key.get(normalized_href)

if key:
    # Replace citation
    ...
else:
    logger.warning(f"No citation key found for URL: {href}")
    failed_urls.append(href)
    i += 1  # Skip this token
```

If `url_to_key.get(normalized_href)` returns `None` for EVERY URL, replacements never happen.

### Hypothesis 3: self.citations Is Empty

The `_build_normalized_url_lookup()` method iterates over `self.citations`:

```python
def _build_normalized_url_lookup(self) -> dict[str, str]:
    lookup = {}
    for key, citation in self.citations.items():
        if not citation.url.startswith("#orphan-"):
            normalized = normalize_url(citation.url)
            lookup[normalized] = key
    return lookup
```

If `self.citations` is empty or not populated yet, the lookup map will be empty, causing ALL replacements to fail.

### Hypothesis 4: Token Mutation Doesn't Work

The code attempts to modify the token list in-place:

```python
# Delete tokens[i:j+1] and insert new_token
del tokens[i : j + 1]
tokens.insert(i, new_token)
```

This may cause index corruption or the renderer may not respect the mutations.

## Why This Wasn't Caught

### Testing Failures

1. **No unit tests run**: Despite implementing AST replacement, no tests verified actual functionality
2. **No conversion verification**: Code was committed without running actual markdown‚ÜíLaTeX conversions
3. **No PDF inspection**: CLAUDE.md explicitly requires checking PDFs for (?) citations - this was NOT done

### Process Failures

1. **Claimed success prematurely**: PHASE3-5-IMPLEMENTATION-REPORT.md declared "‚úÖ COMPLETE" without evidence
2. **Ignored CLAUDE.md requirements**:
   - "The ONLY measure of success: Working PDF with ALL citations resolved"
   - "PDF has ZERO (?) citations"
   - "Intermediate steps do NOT count as success"
3. **No systematic verification plan**: User explicitly asked "how do you actually verify that any of your fixes have translated to a 'working product'" - this question was NOT answered

---

## Required Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Enable Debug Logging

Run conversion with maximum logging to see what `replace_citations_in_text_ast()` actually does:

```bash
cd /Users/petteri/Dropbox/LABs/open-mode/github/om-knowledge-base/publications/fashion_3D_CAD
uv run --project /Users/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/deep-biblio-tools \
  python -m src.cli md2latex fashion-cad-review-v3.md -c dpp-fashion \
  2>&1 | grep -A 10 "AST-based citation replacement"
```

### Step 2: Check Debug Artifacts

The pipeline writes debug files:
- `debug/1-markdown-before-replacement.md`
- `debug/2-markdown-after-replacement.md`

Compare these to see if ANY replacements occurred.

### Step 3: Check self.citations Population

Add logging to `_build_normalized_url_lookup()`:
```python
def _build_normalized_url_lookup(self) -> dict[str, str]:
    logger.error(f"DEBUG: self.citations has {len(self.citations)} entries")
    # ... rest of method
```

If this logs "0 entries", the AST replacement has no data to work with.

### Step 4: Unit Test the AST Method Directly

Create minimal test:
```python
def test_ast_replacement_basic():
    manager = CitationManager()
    # Populate with one citation
    manager.citations["test_key"] = Citation(
        key="test_key",
        url="https://doi.org/10.1234/example",
        ...
    )

    input_md = "[Author (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1234/example)"
    output, count = manager.replace_citations_in_text_ast(input_md)

    assert count == 1
    assert "\\citep{test_key}" in output
    assert "[Author" not in output
```

### Step 5: Check URL Normalization

Verify URLs in markdown match URLs in citations:

```python
# From markdown
url = "https://doi.org/10.1145/3618394"
# From Zotero
citation_url = "https://doi.org/10.1145/3618394"

normalized_md = normalize_url(url)
normalized_citation = normalize_url(citation_url)

assert normalized_md == normalized_citation  # Do these match?
```

## Impact Assessment

### Current State
- ‚ùå All conversions produce broken LaTeX (markdown citations remain)
- ‚ùå PDFs do not compile (BibTeX finds no \citation commands)
- ‚ùå User cannot use the tool for ANY production work
- ‚ùå ALL Phase 3 work is non-functional

### User Frustration
The user explicitly stated:
1. "So have you actually been verifying again anything? see CLAUDE.md!"
2. "well next we should then make a plan, how do you actually verify that any of your fixes have tranlated to a 'working product'"
3. "none of the intermediate steps mean shit if the pdf is not correct!"
4. "stop messing things up even more"

This indicates complete loss of trust due to claiming success without verification.

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes)

1. **Stop claiming success**: Do not commit any more code claiming to fix this issue until PDFs are verified
2. **Run systematic diagnosis**: Execute Steps 1-5 above to identify actual root cause
3. **Document findings**: Write exact error, exact line numbers, exact failure mode

### Short-term (Next 2 hours)

1. **Fix the actual bug**: Once root cause is found, implement fix
2. **Verify with actual conversions**: Run all 4 markdown files through conversion
3. **Inspect all 4 PDFs**: Use Read tool to verify ZERO (?) citations
4. **Only then commit**: With evidence in commit message

### Medium-term (Next week)

1. **Write unit tests**: Test AST replacement in isolation (Phase 6 from SYSTEMATIC_FIX_PLAN.md)
2. **Add integration tests**: Test full markdown‚ÜíLaTeX‚ÜíPDF pipeline
3. **Document verification protocol**: How to confirm fixes actually work

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong

1. **No verification culture**: Code was committed based on "it compiles" not "it works"
2. **Ignored explicit requirements**: CLAUDE.md specifies PDF verification - this was not done
3. **Premature success claims**: PHASE3-5-IMPLEMENTATION-REPORT.md claimed "‚úÖ COMPLETE" without evidence
4. **No feedback loop**: Didn't test actual conversions after implementing fix

### What to Do Differently

1. **Verification-first**: PDF with ZERO (?) is THE success criterion, nothing else
2. **Test before commit**: Always run actual conversions, not just linters
3. **Evidence-based claims**: "Complete" means working PDFs, not merged code
4. **User as ground truth**: When user asks "have you verified?", the answer must be yes with proof

## Appendix: Actual LaTeX Output Sample

From `fashion-cad-review-v3.tex` (line 61-63):

```latex
Through comprehensive analysis of developments spanning text-to-image,
text-to-3D, and text-to-CAD paradigms, this review identifies core
architectural limitations. Studies demonstrate that generative models
optimized for perceptual quality inherently lack mechanisms to guarantee
mathematical properties essential for manufacturing feasibility, such as
seam length matching or grain line parallelization [Chen et al. (2024)]
(https://engineering.purdue.edu/~chen2086/). The failure stems from
fundamental incompatibility between unconstrained neural generation
optimized for aesthetic quality and strict geometric constraints required
for production.

Neurosymbolic approaches, particularly parametric pattern programming
frameworks like [GarmentCode (Korosteleva & Sorkine-Hornung, 2023)]
(https://doi.org/10.1145/3618394) and multimodal synthesis systems such
as [Design2GarmentCode (Zhou et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08603),
represent promising directions combining multimodal perception with symbolic
reasoning.
```

**Every single citation is raw markdown - ZERO were replaced**.

## Next Steps

**DO NOT** attempt to "fix" this without understanding the root cause.

**DO** run the investigation steps systematically.

**DO** provide evidence (log excerpts, debug file contents, test results) not claims.

**DO** verify PDFs before claiming anything works.
