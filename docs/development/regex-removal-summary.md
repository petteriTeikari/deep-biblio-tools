4. **scripts/enhance_github_citations.py**
   - Replaced regex-based GitHub URL parsing with string splitting

5. **scripts/debug_bibliography.py**
   - No regex usage found - no changes needed

6. **scripts/check_no_emojis.py**
   - Replaced regex-based emoji detection with Unicode code point checking

7. **scripts/remove_all_emojis.py**
   - Replaced regex-based emoji detection with Unicode code point checking
   - Replaced regex finditer with character-by-character traversal
   - Replaced regex substitution with character filtering

## Key Techniques Used

### 1. Pattern Matching Without Regex
Instead of regex patterns, we used:
- Character-by-character traversal with state tracking
- String methods like `find()`, `startswith()`, `endswith()`
- Character type checking with `isalpha()`, `isdigit()`, `isupper()`, `islower()`

### 2. Bracket and Parenthesis Matching
For nested structures, we implemented:
- Counter-based tracking for matching brackets/braces
- Manual parsing of nested structures

### 3. Unicode Emoji Detection
Replaced regex Unicode ranges with:
- `ord()` function to get character code points
- Direct numerical comparisons against Unicode ranges

### 4. URL Parsing
Replaced regex URL patterns with:
- String `find()` to locate domain names
- String `split()` to extract path components

### 5. Year and Number Extraction
Replaced regex digit patterns with:
- `isdigit()` method for validation
- String slicing for extraction

## Testing

All functions were tested with sample inputs to ensure they maintain the same functionality as their regex-based counterparts. The string-based implementations successfully:
- Extract citations from markdown
- Parse DOIs and arXiv IDs from URLs
- Detect emoji characters
- Identify suspicious bibliography patterns

## Performance Considerations

While string methods may be slightly less efficient than compiled regex for complex patterns, they offer:
- Better readability and maintainability
- No dependency on the `re` module
- Explicit logic that's easier to debug
- Cross-platform consistency
