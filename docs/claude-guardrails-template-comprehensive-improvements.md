## 1. Critical Template Generation Failures

### 1.1 Template Not Actually Applied
**Discovery**: The repository contained raw Jinja2 template syntax in multiple files, indicating cookiecutter was never properly run.

**Evidence**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` contained `{% if cookiecutter.dependency_manager_python == "uv" -%}`
- Template syntax present instead of processed content
- Missing generated files that cookiecutter should create

**Root Cause**: Repository was created by copying template structure rather than running cookiecutter.

**Fix Required**:
- Add validation that ensures cookiecutter is properly invoked
- Create test suite that generates projects and validates output
- Document proper generation process prominently

### 1.2 GitHub Actions Validation Failures
**Issue**: Validation script requires exact file locations and content patterns.

**Required Files** (with exact locations):
1. `CLAUDE.md` (root) - Must contain: `refer to **.claude/CLAUDE.md**`
2. `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Must have sections: `## Forbidden Actions`, `## Required Patterns`, `## Architecture Context`, `## Development Workflow`
3. `.claude/golden-paths.md` - Development workflows
4. `.claude/auto-context.yaml` - Must contain `patterns:` section

**Fix Required**:
- Template must generate ALL required files with correct content
- Add validation script to template that checks file generation

---

## 2. Missing Required Files

### 2.1 Missing `.claude/auto-context.yaml`
**Impact**: GitHub Actions fail immediately with "Missing required Claude Code guardrail files"

**Template Fix**:
```yaml
# {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/.claude/auto-context.yaml
project:
  name: "{{cookiecutter.project_name}}"
  type: "{{cookiecutter.project_type}}"
  language: "{{cookiecutter.language}}"
  framework: "{{cookiecutter.framework|default('none')}}"
  description: "{{cookiecutter.description}}"

context_files:
  always_include:
    - "CLAUDE.md"
    - ".claude/CLAUDE.md"
    - ".claude/golden-paths.md"
    - "pyproject.toml"
    - "README.md"

patterns:
  related_files:
    "*.py": ["*_test.py", "test_*.py"]
    "src/**/*.py": ["tests/**/test_*.py"]

session_management:
  update_current_session: true
  session_file: ".claude/sessions/current-session.md"
  capture_learnings: true
  learnings_file: ".claude/sessions/learnings.md"
```

### 2.2 Missing Application Entry Points
**Issue**: No `main.py` generated for web applications, causing Docker containers to fail.

**Template Fix**: Add conditional generation based on framework:
```python
# {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/src/{{cookiecutter.package_name}}/{% if cookiecutter.create_main_app == "yes" %}main.py{% endif %}
```

---

## 3. Dependency and Configuration Issues

### 3.1 Dependency Group Mismatch
**Issue**: GitHub Actions expect `test` group, template only generates `dev` group.

**Current Template Error**:
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [...]  # Only dev group exists
```

**Required Fix**:
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [...]
test = [  # GitHub Actions require this
    "pytest>=7.4.0",
    "pytest-cov>=4.1.0",
    "pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0",
]

[dependency-groups]  # Modern uv syntax - template missing entirely
test = [...]
dev = [...]
```

### 3.2 Missing Python Version Requirements
**Issue**: No `requires-python` field causes version conflicts.

**Template Fix**:
```toml
[project]
requires-python = "{{cookiecutter.python_min_version}}"  # Must add this
```

### 3.3 Missing FastAPI Dependencies
**Issue**: Template doesn't include essential dependencies like `python-multipart`.

**Template Fix**: Add complete dependency set for each framework.

---

## 4. Docker and Deployment Problems

### 4.1 Virtual Environment Portability
**Issue**: uv creates non-portable virtual environments with absolute paths.

**Solutions Discovered**:
1. **No-install-project approach**:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN uv sync --frozen --no-dev --no-install-project
   RUN /app/.venv/bin/pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Pure pip fallback**:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN uv export --no-dev > requirements.txt
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 4.2 Environment-Specific Test Failures
**Issues Encountered**:
- tex2lyx unavailable in Docker containers
- arXiv API flaky in CI environments
- Different behavior between local and CI

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Environment detection (`CONTAINER_ENV`, `CI`)
- Conditional test skipping
- Robust availability checks

---

## 5. Pre-commit and Validation Issues

### 5.1 Emoji Check Too Restrictive
**Issue**: Pre-commit prevents emojis in markdown files where they should be allowed.

**Current (Wrong)**:
```yaml
types_or: [python, markdown, yaml, text]  # Includes markdown
```

**Fix Required**:
```yaml
files: '\.(py|sh|yml|yaml|json|toml|txt|cfg|ini|conf)$'
exclude: '^(\.git/|node_modules/|venv/|\.venv/|.*\.md$)'
```

### 5.2 Import Validation Enforcement
**Issues Discovered**:
- Imports inside functions rejected
- Third-party imports before stdlib
- Relative vs absolute import confusion

**Template Should Include**:
- Clear import style guide
- Pre-commit hook for import validation
- Examples of correct patterns

---

## 6. Behavioral and Attention Management

### 6.1 Repository Maturity-Based Behavior
**Problem**: Template treats sandbox experiments the same as production systems.

**Proposed Solution**: Add `.claude/repo-maturity.yaml`:
```yaml
maturity_level: "sandbox|development|staging|production"
behavior_modes:
  production:
    risk_tolerance: zero
    max_files_per_response: 1
    require_explanation_first: true
    ai_personality: "Senior engineer - every change needs justification"
  sandbox:
    risk_tolerance: high
    max_files_per_response: 5
    require_explanation_first: false
    ai_personality: "Experimental mindset - try new approaches"
```

### 6.2 Incremental Development Enforcement
**Problem**: AI tries to do too much at once, loses focus on guardrails.

**Solution**: Enforce limits based on maturity:
- Production: 1 file, 50 lines max, explain first
- Development: 3 files, 200 lines max
- Sandbox: 5 files, 500 lines max

### 6.3 Guardrail Reading Priority
**Problem**: AI reads guardrails "when convenient", not first.

**Solution**: Multi-layered enforcement:
1. Visual cues in CLAUDE.md
2. Forced pauses in production
3. Automated checks that block progress
4. Positive reinforcement for compliance

---

## 7. Real-World Pattern Requirements

### 7.1 Missing API Integration Patterns
**Need**: Base classes for resilient API integration.

**Template Should Generate**:
```python
class BaseAPIClient(ABC):
    """Base class with retry, rate limiting, and validation."""
    def with_retry(self, max_attempts: int = 3):
        """Decorator for automatic retry with exponential backoff."""
```

### 7.2 Missing Caching Implementation
**Need**: Smart caching with TTL and invalidation.

**Template Should Include**:
- Cache base class
- SQLite cache implementation
- Cache invalidation patterns
- Performance monitoring

### 7.3 Missing State Management
**Need**: Checkpoint system for long-running processes.

**Template Should Provide**:
- Process state tracking
- Resume capability
- Failure recovery
- Progress monitoring

### 7.4 Missing Error Recovery Patterns
**Need**: Fallback chains for external dependencies.

**Template Should Include**:
- Fallback chain implementation
- Graceful degradation patterns
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Health check endpoints

---

## 8. Testing and Quality Assurance

### 8.1 Missing Edge Case Tests
**Template Should Generate**:
- Empty input tests
- Malformed input tests
- Unicode handling tests
- Large input performance tests
- Timeout tests

### 8.2 Missing Test Infrastructure
**Needed**:
- Docker test commands in Makefile
- Parallel test execution setup
- Environment parity tests
- Integration test patterns

### 8.3 Template Validation Suite
**Must Create**: `scripts/validate-template.py`
- Test template generation
- Verify all files exist
- Check dependencies install
- Validate Docker builds
- Test GitHub Actions

---

## 9. Documentation and Migration

### 9.1 Missing Migration Guide
**Need**: Step-by-step migration documentation including:
- Pre-migration checklist
- Common issues and solutions
- Validation scripts
- Rollback procedures

### 9.2 Missing Domain-Specific Examples
**Template Should Ask**:
- What type of project? (CLI tool, API service, data processor)
- What external APIs? (to generate appropriate clients)
- Performance requirements? (to configure caching/batching)
- Deployment target? (to customize Docker setup)

### 9.3 Missing Troubleshooting Guide
**Should Include**:
- Common error messages and fixes
- Environment-specific issues
- Debug commands
- Support channels

## 10. Self-Reflection on the Journey

### 10.1 What Worked Well

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Caught many issues early, enforced standards automatically
2. **Incremental Problem Solving**: Using TodoWrite to track issues helped maintain focus
3. **Test-Driven Debugging**: Tests revealed actual issues vs assumed problems
4. **Documentation as Code**: Writing plans before implementing prevented hacks

### 10.2 Key Challenges

1. **Template vs Reality Gap**: The template's idealized structure didn't match real-world needs
2. **Environment Differences**: Local vs Docker vs CI all behaved differently
3. **Policy Enforcement**: Having policies (no regex) without automation led to violations
4. **Hidden Dependencies**: System dependencies (tex2lyx, pandoc) caused unexpected failures

### 10.3 Critical Insights

1. **Templates Must Be Battle-Tested**: Every template feature needs real-world validation
2. **Automation Over Documentation**: Automated checks are more reliable than written rules
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with working basics, add complexity gradually
4. **Environment Parity is Crucial**: What works locally must work in CI/Docker

### 10.4 Behavioral Psychology Lessons

1. **AI Optimization**: LLMs naturally optimize for task completion over rule compliance
2. **Multiple Reinforcement Needed**: Single-layer enforcement always fails
3. **Make Compliance Easier**: Automation should make the right thing the easy thing
4. **Context Switching**: AI loses guardrail context when focused on tasks

## 11. Open Questions and Future Considerations

### 11.1 Template Design Philosophy

1. **Minimal vs Comprehensive**: Should templates start minimal or include everything?
2. **Framework Coupling**: How tightly should templates integrate with specific frameworks?
3. **Update Strategy**: How do users update when template improves?
4. **Customization vs Convention**: Where's the balance between flexibility and standards?

### 11.2 Technical Decisions

1. **Docker Strategy**: Should templates use multi-stage builds universally?
2. **Dependency Management**: Is uv mature enough to be the default?
3. **Python Version Support**: Should templates support multiple Python versions?
4. **CI/CD Complexity**: How much CI/CD is too much for new projects?

### 11.3 Organizational Adoption

1. **Migration Path**: How do we migrate hundreds of existing repos?
2. **Training Requirements**: What training do developers need?
3. **Governance Model**: Who maintains organizational templates?
4. **Success Metrics**: How do we measure template effectiveness?

### 11.4 AI Assistant Integration

1. **Behavior Control**: Can we make AI behavior truly deterministic?
2. **Context Management**: How do we ensure AI always reads guardrails first?
3. **Learning Integration**: Should templates learn from usage patterns?
4. **Error Recovery**: How do we help AI recover from guardrail violations?

### 11.5 Future Features

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Should templates include APM integration?
2. **Security Scanning**: Should security checks be built-in?
3. **Documentation Generation**: Can we auto-generate API docs?
4. **Deployment Automation**: Should templates include k8s manifests?

### 11.6 Community and Ecosystem

1. **Template Marketplace**: Should there be domain-specific template variants?
2. **Plugin System**: Can templates be extended with plugins?
3. **Version Compatibility**: How do we handle breaking changes?
4. **Contribution Model**: How can the community improve templates?

## Final Recommendations

1. **Start with Working Basics**: Get minimal template working end-to-end first
2. **Test Everything**: Every feature needs automated tests
3. **Document Reality**: Document what actually works, not what should work
4. **Prioritize Developer Experience**: Make the right thing the easy thing
5. **Learn from Usage**: Track how templates are actually used and adapt

The goal is a template that works perfectly on first generation, requiring zero manual fixes for common use cases. This will enable organizational adoption and make Claude Code Guardrails accessible to all developers, regardless of their DevOps expertise.

## Appendix: Quick Start for Template Fixes

```bash
cd ../claude-code-guardrails-template

# Read these files first:
cat ../deep-biblio-tools/.claude/sessions/cookiecutter-template-fixes-plan.md
cat ../deep-biblio-tools/.claude/sessions/template-fix-checklist.md

# Start with critical fixes
# Test after EVERY change
# Document all discoveries
```

Remember: The template's success is measured by how little manual intervention is required after generation.
