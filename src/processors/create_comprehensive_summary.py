## Abstract
{sections["abstract"] if sections["abstract"] else 'Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems play a crucial role in providing various services and creating comfortable environments for urban residents. In order to enhance the management efficiency of these highly complex MEP systems, as-built building information models (BIMs) are being increasingly adopted worldwide. As-built BIMs accurately represent the actual conditions of facilities, making as-built BIM reconstruction significantly important for construction progress tracking, quality assurance, subsequent facility management, and renewal. To create as-built BIMs for MEP systems, laser scanners are widely utilized to capture high-resolution images and dense 3D measurements of the environment in a fast and highly accurate manner. Despite research efforts to automatically achieve "Scan-to-BIM," there are still gaps in applying current solutions to real-world scenarios. One of the major challenges are the limited generalization of existing methods to unseen scenarios without proper training or fine-tuning on custom-designed datasets. To address this issue, this study introduces Omni-Scan2BIM, a novel approach powered by large-scale pre-trained vision foundation models. Omni-Scan2BIM enables the recognition of MEP-related components with a single shot by integrating an all-purpose feature extraction model and a class-agnostic segmentation model. The approach demonstrates over 90% accuracy in recognizing tubular components in unseen scenarios.'}

## 1. Introduction

The adoption of Building Information Model (BIM) has demonstrated significant potential in improving project efficiency throughout the entire lifecycle of facilities, encompassing planning, design, construction, and operation and maintenance (O&M). Among these stages, the O&M phase consumes the most time and incurs the highest costs. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), inadequate interoperability in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry results in an annual additional cost of $15.8 billion, with $10.6 billion attributed to the O&M phase.

Mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) systems provide essential services and create comfortable environments to occupants. In large-scale public projects, such as healthcare centers or biotech industries, the investment associated with MEP systems can account for over 50% of the total project cost. During the O&M phase, BIM technology enables more intelligent facility management by digitizing and integrating a vast amount of documents and drawings within BIMs.

However, unlike disciplines such as architecture and structure, the disparities between the as-designed BIMs and as-built BIMs for MEP systems are substantial. These discrepancies arise from frequent design changes or deviations during assembly, rendering it impractical to directly utilize the as-designed BIMs for tracking construction progress and managing facilities during the operational stage.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Semantic-rich 3D Point Cloud Generation
The acquisition of semantic-rich 3D point clouds plays a crucial role in the Scan2BIM process. Two main approaches exist:
1. Mapping 2D segmentation results into 3D space
2. Direct 3D segmentation on point clouds

Since the introduction of fully convolutional networks (FCN) in 2014 (Long et al., 2014), significant advancements have been made in 2D image semantic segmentation. Recent transformer-based models like SETR (Zheng et al., 2018), SegFormer (Xie et al., 2019), and Segmenter (Strudel et al., 2020) showcase improved performance.

For 3D methods, PointNet (Qi et al., 2021) pioneered deep learning for point cloud processing, followed by PointNet++ (Qi et al., 2022), RandLA-Net (Hu et al., 2023), and KP-FCNN (Thomas et al., 2024). Recent data-efficient approaches include PointContrast (Xie et al., 2025), Contrastive Scene Contexts (Hou et al., 2026), and SQN (Zhao et al., 2027).

### 2.2 As-built BIM Reconstruction for MEP Systems
MEP components can be categorized into:
- **Regular-shaped components**: Tubular components with constant cross sections (pipes, ducts)
- **Irregular-shaped components**: Complex shapes like valves and pumps

Previous research has focused on cylindrical pipe detection using RANSAC-based methods (Schnabel et al., 2030) and centerline-based approaches. Recent deep learning adaptations include DeepPipes (Cheng et al., 2038), PipeNet (Xie et al., 2039), and DSCNet (Qi et al., 2040).

### 2.3 Vision Foundation Models
Pre-trained foundation models like CLIP (Radford et al., 2045), ALIGN (Jia et al., 2046), and DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2047) demonstrate robust zero-shot transfer capabilities. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) (Kirillov et al., 2048) introduces promptable segmentation with impressive zero-shot performance.

## 3. Methodology

The Omni-Scan2BIM approach consists of four sequential modules:

### 3.1 Foundation Model-based Feature Extraction
- Utilizes DINOv2 to extract pixel-level deep descriptors
- Processes both sample images with target components and on-site images
- Generates visual features Fs and Ft for comparison

### 3.2 Similarity Map Generation and Prior Point Sampling
- Compares visual features between target object and on-site images
- Generates similarity maps indicating probability of each pixel belonging to target category
- Samples prior points from local maxima of similarity map

### 3.3 Sequential Class-agnostic Segmentation
- Employs SAM's prompt encoder to process prior points
- Performs sequential segmentation of contiguous regions
- Generates 2D segmentation masks for target components

### 3.4 Shape Analysis and BIM Reconstruction
- Projects 2D segmentation masks to 3D space using transformation matrices
- Extracts skeletons of tubular objects
- Reconstructs parametric BIMs based on geometric analysis

## 4. Validation and Results

Experiments were conducted using data from a real construction site in Hong Kong. Key findings include:

### Performance Metrics
- **Recognition Accuracy**: Over 90% of tubular components successfully recognized
- **Generalization**: Effective performance on unseen scenarios without training
- **Processing Efficiency**: Significant improvement over traditional methods

### Comparative Analysis
The Omni-Scan2BIM approach demonstrated:
- Superior accuracy compared to traditional Scan2BIM methods
- Reduced processing time for large-scale MEP scenes
- Better handling of occlusions and complex configurations

## 5. Conclusions

This study introduces Omni-Scan2BIM, a ready-to-use Scan2BIM approach for MEP scenes utilizing vision foundation models. Key contributions include:

1. **Novel Integration**: First application of vision foundation models (DINOv2 and SAM) for Scan2BIM in MEP scenarios
2. **One-shot Learning**: Ability to recognize components with just a single sample image
3. **High Accuracy**: Over 90% recognition rate for tubular components in unseen scenarios
4. **Practical Application**: No training or fine-tuning required on custom datasets

### Future Work
- Extension to more complex MEP component types
- Integration with real-time scanning systems
- Development of automated quality assurance mechanisms
