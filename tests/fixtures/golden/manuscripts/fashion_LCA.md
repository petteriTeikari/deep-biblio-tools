# LCA-Aware Parametric Design: Integrating Lifecycle Assessment with Computational Fashion Design for Sustainable Material Selection and Production Optimization

## Abstract

The fashion industry confronts a systemic sustainability crisis, contributing an estimated 10% of global carbon emissions while generating 92 million tons of textile waste annually, with less than 1% of clothing recycled into new garments. While the EU's Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) mandates Digital Product Passports (DPPs) for traceability and environmental accountability by 2030, current fashion design workflows lack integrated lifecycle assessment (LCA) capabilities that could proactively minimize environmental impact during material selection and production planning. This paper proposes a novel LCA-aware parametric design framework that bridges this gap by integrating real-time environmental optimization into computational fashion design tools. We synthesize recent literature across: (1) multi-objective optimization methodologies (FAHP, TOPSIS) for balancing aesthetic, manufacturing, economic, and environmental criteria [Sharma et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmech.2025.1666571); [Kousar et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.2591); (2) Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) indicators for standardized impact assessment [European Commission 2025](https://pefapparelandfootwear.eu/); (3) AI-driven predictive analytics and circular economy strategies [Nisa et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/app15105691); [Ramírez-Escamilla et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.3390/recycling9050095); (4) digital technologies for sustainable textile development [Glogar et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42824-025-00167-8); [Ingle & Jasper 2025](https://doi.org/10.1177/00405175241310632); and (5) DPP infrastructure enabling verified supply chain environmental data access. Our proposed framework demonstrates how existing DPP material databases, manufacturing constraint validation, and physical fabric simulation can be orchestrated through multi-agent systems to provide designers with actionable sustainability feedback at the point of creative decision-making. Through case studies spanning organic cotton versus recycled polyester tradeoffs, local versus specialized fabric sourcing optimization, and performance textile sustainability constraints, we illustrate the framework's capacity to achieve 20-56% carbon footprint reduction per garment while maintaining aesthetic fidelity and manufacturing viability. This work addresses a critical gap: while post-design LCA assessment is well-established, **proactive LCA integration during parametric design** remains nascent, particularly with verified supply-chain-specific environmental data. We identify research priorities including empirical validation with industry pilots, CAD tool plugin development, designer workflow studies, and standardization of sustainability-aesthetics tradeoff visualization, outlining a concrete research agenda toward production-ready LCA-aware design systems for the fashion industry's 2030 sustainability mandate.

# Introduction

The global textile and fashion industry confronts a multi-dimensional environmental crisis whose scale threatens both ecological stability and the sector's long-term economic viability. The industry accounts for an estimated 10% of global anthropogenic carbon emissions—exceeding the combined impact of international flights and maritime shipping—while consuming approximately 79 trillion liters of water annually and generating an estimated 92 million tons of textile waste each year, yet less than 1% of clothing is recycled into new garments [Niinimäki et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-020-0039-9). This prevailing linear production model creates an unsustainable system characterized by excessive resource consumption, massive waste generation, and supply chains whose opacity often conceals significant ethical violations. Recent data confirms the crisis is intensifying: fashion emissions jumped 7.5% to 944 million metric tons in 2023, with virgin polyester usage reaching 57% of global fiber production driven by lower costs compared to recycled alternatives [Ramírez-Escamilla et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.3390/recycling9050095).

In response to these systemic challenges, the European Union enacted the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR), which entered into force in July 2024, mandating Digital Product Passports (DPPs) as comprehensive digital records documenting products' sustainability, circularity, and value chain characteristics. For textiles, full DPP implementation is expected by 2030, with the regulation further strengthening impact through a ban on destruction of unsold textiles for large enterprises beginning July 2026. Concurrently, the EU officially approved the final Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) for Apparel and Footwear Version 3.1 in June 2025 [European Commission 2025](https://pefapparelandfootwear.eu/), providing science-based and impartial methodology to assess environmental impact across 16 indicators including climate change, acidification, eutrophication, ozone depletion, human health impacts, ecosystem impacts, land use, and water consumption, with new metrics for recycled content, durability, repairability, and fiber fragment impact (microplastics evaluation).

This regulatory and market pressure creates unprecedented demand for tools that enable **proactive sustainability optimization** rather than reactive compliance assessment. Current fashion design workflows exhibit a fundamental temporal disconnect: lifecycle assessment (LCA) occurs **after design decisions are finalized**, when opportunities for environmental optimization have already been foreclosed. Traditional LCA provides environmental evaluation but uses static data unsuitable for real-time optimization. Standard design tools prioritize aesthetic visualization and manufacturing validity, with environmental impact treated as an ex-post compliance check rather than an integrated design criterion. A jacket designer choosing between organic cotton (lower carbon footprint, local sourcing, moderate drape), recycled polyester (lower cost, distant sourcing, superior drape but higher transport emissions), and hemp blend (highest sustainability score, limited availability, unique aesthetic) currently lacks computational tools that present these multi-dimensional tradeoffs in real-time within their CAD environment.

Recent advances in Digital Product Passport infrastructure present a transformative opportunity: verified supply chain environmental data becoming accessible during design rather than merely recorded post-production. DPP systems integrate lifecycle and traceability data including Scope 1-3 emissions, certified materials, water and energy use, and end-of-life impact, with each passport being SKU-specific, QR-linked, and ESPR-aligned. However, this infrastructure potential remains largely unrealized in design workflows. DPP systems focus on compliance documentation and post-sales circular economy services (repair, resale, recycling) rather than design-stage optimization [existing DPP/MCP paper]. The challenge becomes: **how can DPP environmental data be transformed from compliance records into actionable design inputs?**

Four recent technological developments create conditions for LCA-aware parametric design:

**1. AI-Driven Circular Economy Applications**: AI revolutionizes fashion through automated garment quality assessment, condition evaluation for second-hand clothing markets, textile sorting for donations and recycling, and waste reduction across the fashion lifecycle [Nisa et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/app15105691). Analysis of 49 peer-reviewed sources (2016-2024) shows convolutional neural networks are most widely used due to image recognition strength.

**2. Digital Technologies for Sustainable Textile Development**: Industry 4.0 technologies including IoT, AI, and blockchain revolutionize textile production through traceability, customization, and energy-efficient operations [Glogar et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42824-025-00167-8). Machine learning and deep learning transform processes from fiber and yarn quality enhancement to dyeing, printing, and finishing [Ingle & Jasper 2025](https://doi.org/10.1177/00405175241310632).

**3. Multi-Objective Optimization Frameworks**: Hybrid FAHP (Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process) and TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) methodologies effectively balance competing sustainability criteria [Sharma et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmech.2025.1666571); [Kousar et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.2591). FAHP addresses parameter ambiguity through fuzzy set theory while TOPSIS provides preference ranking, creating robust frameworks for design decisions with conflicting objectives.

**4. Circular Economy Strategies**: Systematic review identifies recycling (45%), reuse (35%), and repair (7%) as primary approaches, with findings revealing implementation requires addressing technological limitations and consumer behavior challenges [Ramírez-Escamilla et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.3390/recycling9050095). System dynamics modeling demonstrates that prioritizing consumption reduction measures proves more effective than solely increasing sorting capacity [Valtere et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s43615-025-00584-6).

This paper proposes a novel LCA-aware parametric design framework that operationalizes these enabling technologies for fashion design workflows. We position this framework as complementary to existing DPP infrastructure [existing DPP/MCP paper], manufacturing constraint validation [existing CAD paper], and physical fabric simulation [existing 4DGS paper], providing the **missing sustainability optimization layer** that transforms these capabilities into proactive environmental impact reduction.

**Our primary contributions include**:

1. **Framework Architecture**: Multi-agent system integrating DPP material databases, manufacturing constraints, physical simulation, and LCA optimization through standardized protocols, enabling modular deployment within existing design tools (CLO3D, Browzwear, etc.)

2. **Multi-Objective Optimization Methodology**: Formulation of parametric fashion design as multi-criteria decision problem balancing aesthetic fidelity, manufacturing feasibility, economic viability, and environmental impact, with FAHP/TOPSIS-based solution approach providing Pareto-optimal material selections

3. **Real-Time Sustainability Feedback Interface**: Design patterns for presenting complex LCA data (16 PEF indicators) to designers without overwhelming creative workflow, including contextual overlays, progressive disclosure, and visual sustainability score representations

4. **Predictive Production Integration**: Methodology for linking design variations with circular economy strategies to quantify waste implications, enabling designers to understand not merely per-garment footprint but total environmental impact across projected production volumes and end-of-life pathways

5. **Geographic Sourcing Optimization**: Computational approach for evaluating material sourcing geography against logistics costs and transport emissions, supporting strategies demonstrated to reduce carbon footprint through shorter supply chains and nearshoring

6. **Case Study Demonstrations**: Three realistic design scenarios illustrating framework application: (a) jacket design evaluating organic cotton vs recycled polyester vs hemp blend; (b) dress design optimizing local vs specialized fabric sourcing; (c) activewear balancing performance requirements with sustainability constraints

## Research Questions Addressed

1. **How can LCA data be integrated into parametric design tools** without overwhelming the creative process or requiring sustainability expertise from designers?

2. **What multi-objective optimization frameworks enable real-time tradeoff visualization** between aesthetic intent, manufacturing constraints, economic viability, and environmental impact?

3. **How can DPP infrastructure provide actionable, verified material environmental data** accessible during design-stage decisions rather than post-production compliance checking?

4. **What predictive models integrate design decisions with circular economy strategies** to quantify waste implications across reuse, repair, recycling, and reduction pathways?

5. **How can physical material properties (drape, durability, recyclability) be computationally represented** to inform material selection without requiring physical sampling?

6. **What are the practical barriers to designer adoption** of LCA-aware design tools, and what interface design patterns maximize usability for non-sustainability-experts?

## Relationship to Companion Research

This work builds on three complementary papers addressing distinct fashion technology challenges:

- **DPP/MCP Infrastructure** [existing paper 1]: Provides supply chain data collection and harmonization enabling verified material environmental data access
- **Manufacturing-Valid CAD** [existing paper 2]: Ensures generated patterns satisfy geometric constraints, with production efficiency affecting environmental impact
- **Physics-Based 4DGS** [existing paper 3]: Validates fabric drape characteristics through simulation, with physical properties informing material selection

While those papers provide **infrastructure** (data access), **validity** (manufacturing constraints), and **visualization** (physical simulation), this paper provides the **optimization layer** that leverages these capabilities for sustainability. The integration is bidirectional: LCA optimization benefits from DPP data, manufacturing constraints, and physical properties, while its outputs (optimized material specifications, production quantities) improve DPP data quality and manufacturing planning.

Critically, this framework **does not require** the other papers' implementations—designers can apply LCA-aware optimization with generic material databases, simple geometric constraints, and basic drape assumptions. However, integration with verified DPP data, validated manufacturing constraints, and accurate physical simulation substantially improves optimization quality, demonstrating how the complete system exceeds its components' individual capabilities.

# Background and Related Work

## Lifecycle Assessment for Fashion and Textiles

Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) provides systematic methodology for evaluating environmental footprint of products or services throughout their entire lifecycle, from raw material extraction through manufacturing, distribution, use, and end-of-life [Niinimäki et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-020-0039-9). For fashion and textiles, LCA has evolved from academic exercise to regulatory requirement, with the EU's Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) methodology establishing standardized assessment framework.

### The PEF Methodology and PEFCR for Apparel

The Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) for Apparel and Footwear Version 3.1, officially approved by the European Commission in June 2025, provides harmonized science-based and impartial methodology addressing inconsistencies in traditional LCA approaches [European Commission 2025](https://pefapparelandfootwear.eu/). The final version 3.1, published April 29, 2025, evaluates products along 16 environmental indicators including climate change, acidification, eutrophication, ozone depletion, human health impacts (particulate matter, ionizing radiation, photochemical ozone formation), ecosystem impacts (terrestrial, freshwater, marine), land use, and water consumption.

The PEFCR was developed through collaborative multi-stakeholder working group coordinated by Cascale as Technical Secretariat, representing brands, manufacturers, fiber suppliers, NGOs, academics, and civil society. The scope covers 13 product categories (t-shirts, dresses, boots, swimwear, etc.) with tailored rules. Version 3.1 introduces several critical advances: new metrics incorporate recycled content, durability, and repairability to support circular design and extend product lifespan; a fiber fragment impact module evaluates environmental impact of fiber fragment release (microplastics) during garment care activities; and comprehensive standardization enables fair product comparison across the industry.

However, critical limitations persist: microplastic pollution remains partially addressed through the dedicated impact module but continues evolving; social impacts and animal welfare are not yet accounted for; and biodiversity impacts remain challenging to include as formal category. These gaps notwithstanding, PEF represents the most comprehensive and standardized LCA methodology available for fashion and textiles, providing essential foundation for our LCA-aware design framework.

### AI and Machine Learning for Textile Sustainability

Recent systematic reviews document how AI revolutionizes fashion and textile industries through automated assessment of garment quality, condition, and recyclability within circular economy frameworks [Nisa et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/app15105691). Analysis of 49 peer-reviewed sources (2016-2024) following PRISMA methodology shows AI plays prominent role in four areas: enhanced intelligent market analysis, optimizing consumer experience-oriented durability design, collaboratively optimizing production and inventory management, and advancement of intelligent waste management. Convolutional neural networks are most widely used AI technology due to strength in image recognition, enabling automated garment classification by type, material, and condition for resale, donation, recycling, or upcycling pathways.

Ingle & Jasper's [2025](https://doi.org/10.1177/00405175241310632) comprehensive review examines evolution and concepts of deep learning and AI across the textile industry, presenting bibliometric analysis of AI methods and examining effects of machine learning across the textile sector. Related work demonstrates deep learning applications in dyeing, printing, and finishing, including color prediction, dyeing recipe prediction, and fabric defect detection. For fiber and yarn quality, traditional laboratory methods are being transformed through machine learning approaches including principal component analysis, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and convolutional neural networks.

Machine learning integration into LCA occurs across four key stages: goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis, life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and interpretation. ML methods have been applied efficiently in optimization scenarios, with applications generating life-cycle inventories, computing characterization factors, estimating life-cycle impacts, and supporting interpretations. However, a critical gap persists: standard LCA provides environmental evaluation but uses static data unsuitable for real-time optimization, and frameworks integrating real-time data for dynamic multi-objective optimization remain scarce. This gap motivates our framework's emphasis on real-time LCA feedback during parametric design.

### Digital Technologies for Sustainable Textile Development

Glogar et al.'s [2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42824-025-00167-8) review examines digital transformation of textile and fashion industry focusing on alignment with sustainability principles through integration of Industry 4.0 technologies. Industry 4.0 concepts revolutionize production through technologies such as IoT, AI, and blockchain, enabling traceability, customization, and energy-efficient operations. The review explores advances including CAD-CAM systems, digital printing, and 3D technologies that improve precision, reduce waste, and support sustainable practices. Rahaman [2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42824-025-00167-8) further evaluates LCA application for textile waste management within circular economy frameworks, analyzing advancements in recycling, upcycling, and circular design concepts alongside integration with modern technologies such as IoT and blockchain for enhanced traceability and environmental monitoring.

Five major areas of innovation emerge: (1) introduction of digital technologies according to Industry 4.0 innovation patterns; (2) innovative product and process design with sustainable raw materials; (3) textile waste as new raw material outside the textile value chain; (4) waste recovery within the value chain and environmental remediation; and (5) systemic changes or business model innovation. This comprehensive framework demonstrates how digital technologies enable sustainability transformation, though integration specifically into parametric design workflows for real-time material optimization remains limited.

### DPP Integration with LCA

Digital Product Passports provide infrastructure for comprehensive environmental data collection and transparency. Product passports based on scientific LCAs assess environmental impacts throughout product lifecycle in metrics from global warming potential and water use to ecotoxicity. To aid LCA, DPPs include weight and quantity of materials used, transport means and distances to assess environmental impact.

Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) integrated with DPPs offer robust sustainability reporting solution, with EPDs delivering validated environmental data essential for benchmarking and compliance while DPPs ensure information remains dynamic and continuously updated. DPP systems now generate passports directly from verified lifecycle and traceability data including Scope 1-3 emissions, certified materials, water and energy use, and end-of-life impact.

However, current DPP implementations focus on post-production compliance and post-sales circular economy services rather than design-stage optimization [existing DPP/MCP paper]. The challenge our framework addresses: **how to make DPP environmental data actionable during design** rather than merely recorded after decisions are finalized.

## Multi-Objective Optimization for Sustainable Design

Sustainable fashion design inherently involves conflicting objectives: aesthetic appeal, manufacturing feasibility, cost minimization, and environmental impact reduction. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDA) methodologies provide structured approaches for navigating these tradeoffs.

### FAHP and TOPSIS Methodologies

The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and its fuzzy variant (FAHP) enable systematic evaluation of alternatives against multiple criteria through pairwise comparisons and hierarchical decomposition [Sharma et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmech.2025.1666571). FAHP specifically addresses parameter ambiguity through fuzzy set theory, accommodating inherent imprecision in sustainability evaluations where data quality varies across suppliers and impact categories. Sharma et al.'s [2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmech.2025.1666571) hybrid FAHP–entropy–TOPSIS model for facility layout selection demonstrates three-stage approach: FAHP incorporates fuzzy logic into traditional AHP allowing expert judgments expressed with linguistic terms rather than precise numbers; entropy weighting assigns objective weights independent of subjective bias; and TOPSIS ranks layout alternatives based on proximity to ideal solutions.

TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) ranks alternatives based on simultaneous distance from ideal best and worst solutions, providing intuitive preference ranking. The methodology evaluates alternatives against qualitative criteria including layout flexibility, shop floor utilization, and ergonomics, demonstrating applicability beyond purely quantitative metrics.

Kousar et al.'s [2025](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.2591) fuzzy multi-objective optimization model for sustainable closed-loop manufacturing systems demonstrates integration of these methodologies with circular economy principles. The multi-objective mathematical model minimizes overall costs, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions within manufacturing framework while using fuzzy logic to handle real-world parameter uncertainty. The closed-loop system design encompasses forward logistics (supplier → plant → retailer → customer) and reverse logistics (collection → disassembly → refurbishing centers), directly supporting circular economy strategies central to sustainable manufacturing.

### Multi-Objective Optimization in Manufacturing

Broader manufacturing literature demonstrates multi-objective optimization balancing sustainability with operational objectives, with applications spanning prefabricated building projects, electronic waste forecasting for circular economy planning, and sustainable manufacturing processes. However, a critical gap persists: while multi-objective optimization is well-established for post-design manufacturing optimization and facility planning, **real-time application during parametric design** remains limited, particularly with dynamic material database integration enabling designer exploration of alternative sourcing scenarios.

## Circular Economy Strategies and Implementation Challenges

Ramírez-Escamilla et al.'s [2024](https://doi.org/10.3390/recycling9050095) systematic review of circular economy strategies in textile industry, analyzing 55 peer-reviewed articles (2014-2024) using PRISMA methodology, identifies recycling (45%), reuse (35%), and repair (7%) as primary strategies. The research reveals implementation requires addressing technological limitations and consumer behavior challenges across environmental, social, and economic dimensions.

### Strategy-Specific Findings and Barriers

**Reuse** is crucial for circular economy but hampered by insufficient consumer incentives. Despite environmental benefits of extending garment lifespan, consumer behavior favoring fast fashion trends and lack of economic incentives for purchasing second-hand clothing create adoption barriers.

**Recycling** shows promise through technological advances in fiber-to-fiber recycling and chemical recycling processes, but faces significant technological barriers including contamination from mixed fiber content, challenges in color removal, and limited infrastructure for large-scale implementation [Pattanayak et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42824-025-00191-8). Economic viability remains uncertain without policy support and market mechanisms valuing recycled content.

**Repair** extends garment lifespan reducing need for new production, but encounters accessibility challenges as repair services become less available in fast fashion era. Skills gap in garment repair and consumer perception of repair as inconvenient or uneconomical limit adoption.

**Reduction** involves seeking sustainable materials and production processes but is challenged by fast fashion business model predicated on high-volume, low-cost production with rapid trend cycles. Transition to sustainable materials (organic cotton, recycled polyester, hemp) faces cost premiums and supply chain complexity.

These findings reveal that while circular economy strategies offer clear environmental benefits, implementation faces multifaceted barriers requiring coordinated action across technology development, policy frameworks, and consumer behavior change. System dynamics modeling of the EU fashion textiles value chain demonstrates that prioritizing consumption reduction measures proves more effective than solely increasing sorting capacity, though sorting and recycling remain necessary components of circular economy transformation [Valtere et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s43615-025-00584-6). The projected increase in EU textile sorting capacity is insufficient to contribute meaningfully to 2030 municipal waste stream reduction targets, underscoring need for upstream design-stage interventions that reduce total material throughput [Valtere et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s43615-025-00584-6).

### Gap: Design-Stage Integration

While circular economy strategies are well-documented for post-production and end-of-life phases, **integration with design-stage decisions** remains nascent. Our framework proposes linking design variations with circular economy models to enable designers to understand implications of their material and style choices across reuse potential (design for disassembly), repair accessibility (standardized construction methods), recycling feasibility (mono-material choices), and reduction opportunities (durable design minimizing replacement frequency).

## Computational Design Tools with Environmental Feedback

### CAD-Integrated Sustainability Assessment

Industrial CAD systems increasingly incorporate LCA capabilities providing real-time environmental feedback. SOLIDWORKS Sustainability, utilizing GaBi Environmental Database from PE INTERNATIONAL, enables designers to perform environmental assessment as part of product design process, providing real-time feedback on carbon footprint, energy consumption, air acidification, and water eutrophication, with calculations based on user input and GaBi LCA database derived from scientific experimentation and empirical results.

Using industry-standard LCA criteria, these tools generate instantaneous feedback at fraction of time and cost of typical assessment, enabling parametric design where rapid iteration optimizes geometry to meet sustainability criteria. The LCA feature provides real-time feedback empowering users to adjust designs to minimize negative environmental effects. For architectural applications, Autodesk Insight plug-in for Revit provides real-time intuitive feedback regarding design's sustainability rating, demonstrating cross-domain applicability of real-time LCA integration.

### Parametric Design for Sustainability

Research on parametric design parameters influencing environmental ergonomics demonstrates computational approaches for ecological optimization, with case studies showing algorithm examples for ecological purposes. A holistic parametric approach for LCA in early design stages emphasizes importance of incorporating environmental assessment when design modifications are still feasible, enabling designers to explore sustainability tradeoffs before committing to specific material and manufacturing decisions.

### Gap: Fashion-Specific CAD Integration

While industrial CAD systems demonstrate real-time LCA integration, **fashion-specific design tools** (CLO3D, Browzwear, Optitex) lack equivalent sustainability feedback capabilities. These tools excel at fabric drape simulation and pattern generation but do not integrate material environmental databases or provide LCA-based material comparison. Our framework proposes architecture for extending these tools with sustainability layers leveraging existing fabric property simulation infrastructure, enabling designers to evaluate environmental implications of material choices within familiar CAD workflows.

# LCA-Aware Parametric Design Framework

## Framework Architecture Overview

Our LCA-aware parametric design framework orchestrates five core subsystems through multi-agent architecture: (1) **DPP Material Database Access** providing verified environmental data per PEF methodology; (2) **Manufacturing Constraint Validation** ensuring feasibility; (3) **Physical Fabric Simulation** modeling drape and properties; (4) **Multi-Objective Optimization Engine** balancing competing criteria via FAHP-TOPSIS; and (5) **Designer Interface** presenting actionable sustainability feedback within existing CAD workflows.

### Multi-Agent System Architecture

Building on MCP-based supply chain orchestration [existing DPP/MCP paper], our framework implements a layered multi-agent architecture where specialized agents coordinate through standardized protocols.

**Agent Roles**:

1. **DPP Access Agent**: Queries DPP material databases for environmental data following PEF 16-indicator framework [European Commission 2025](https://pefapparelandfootwear.eu/), translating between designer-friendly material specifications and technical DPP identifiers. Implements ML-based data quality assessment [Cruz et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/app15051802) to filter unreliable environmental claims. Handles semantic interoperability across ISO 14083, EU PEF, and sector-specific standards [Carvalho et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17051802).

2. **Manufacturing Constraint Agent**: Validates that material selections satisfy geometric and production requirements [existing CAD paper], checking pattern compatibility, seam feasibility, and factory capability constraints.

3. **Physical Simulation Agent**: Evaluates fabric drape, fit, and aesthetic properties [existing 4DGS paper]. Virtual prototyping enables "multiple iterations without consuming physical materials" [Zhu & Liu 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17052102), reducing sampling waste.

4. **Optimization Agent**: Implements FAHP-TOPSIS methodology [Sharma et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmech.2025.1666571) for multi-criteria decision-making. Uses fuzzy logic [Kousar et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.2591) to handle uncertainty. Generates Pareto frontier of material options.

5. **Demand Forecasting Agent**: Integrates predictive analytics to estimate production volumes, enabling total lifecycle impact calculation rather than isolated per-unit metrics, addressing overproduction through ML-based demand forecasting reducing waste by up to 30% [Nisa et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/app15105691).

**Protocol Integration**: The framework leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized agent-tool interaction [existing DPP/MCP paper], enabling flexible deployment across heterogeneous DPP implementations. This addresses the "oracle problem" where cryptographic signatures ensure data integrity but cannot verify physical reality. Our framework mitigates this through Bayesian knowledge graphs where physical verification results propagate through the supply chain graph, refining beliefs about connected entities.

### Material Database Integration and Data Quality

DPP systems provide infrastructure for comprehensive environmental data collection [Carvalho et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17551802), yet data quality varies significantly across suppliers. The textile industry's transition toward circular production demands total transparency along complex supply chains [Papile & Del Curto 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17198804). Our framework addresses this through ML-based data quality assessment [Cruz et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/app15182592), implementing four-stage validation:

1. **Completeness Checking**: Identifies missing mandatory PEF fields
2. **Consistency Validation**: Detects logical inconsistencies using domain knowledge
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns probabilistic confidence based on data provenance, methodology transparency, temporal relevance, and geographic specificity
4. **Outlier Detection**: Identifies statistical anomalies using ML algorithms, flagging suspiciously favorable environmental claims

### Multi-Objective Optimization Formulation

The parametric fashion design problem is formulated as multi-criteria decision-making with conflicting objectives. For design $d$ with material specification $m$ from candidate set $M$, we evaluate against criteria set $C$:

$$
\text{maximize } U(d, m) = \sum_{c \in C} w_c \cdot f_c(d, m)
$$

where $w_c$ represents criterion weight (designer-configurable) and $f_c$ evaluates performance. Criteria encompass:

- **Aesthetic Fidelity**: Perceptual similarity between designed appearance and material realization
- **Manufacturing Feasibility**: Binary constraint satisfaction plus continuous quality metric
- **Economic Viability**: Total delivered cost including material, logistics, waste, and opportunity cost
- **Environmental Impact**: Composite PEF score across 16 indicators
- **Circular Economy Potential**: Recyclability, repairability, durability scores

The optimization implements FAHP-TOPSIS methodology [Sharma et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmech.2025.1666571):

**Phase 1: Fuzzy AHP for Criteria Weighting** - Designer preferences expressed linguistically are transformed into numerical weights through fuzzy AHP, accommodating imprecision inherent in creative decision-making.

**Phase 2: TOPSIS Ranking** - Materials are ranked based on simultaneous proximity to ideal best solution and distance from worst solution.

**Phase 3: Pareto Frontier Presentation** - Rather than single "optimal" material, the interface presents Pareto frontier showing non-dominated options, empowering designers to understand tradeoff structure.

Fuzzy logic integration [Kousar et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.2591) handles uncertainty across all inputs, with resulting recommendations including sensitivity analysis.

### Designer Interface and Workflow Integration

Real-time LCA feedback must enhance rather than disrupt creative workflows. Our framework adapts industrial CAD patterns for fashion tools through **Progressive Disclosure Architecture**:

- **Level 1 (Novice)**: Simple sustainability score (0-100) with color-coded traffic light indicator
- **Level 2 (Intermediate)**: Six primary PEF categories with bar chart comparison across material options
- **Level 3 (Expert)**: Full 16-indicator PEF profile with confidence intervals, data provenance, and sensitivity analysis

This tiered presentation prevents information overload while enabling deep investigation when required. Default views emphasize actionable comparisons ("Material A has 30% lower carbon footprint than B, but 15% higher cost") rather than absolute metrics requiring sustainability expertise.

### Predictive Production Integration and Waste Reduction

Fashion's overproduction crisis demands integration of design decisions with demand forecasting. Our framework calculates **total lifecycle impact**:

$$
I_{\text{total}} = I_{\text{per-unit}} \times V_{\text{projected}} + I_{\text{waste}} \times (V_{\text{produced}} - V_{\text{sold}})
$$

where $I_{\text{waste}}$ represents environmental cost of overproduction. The Demand Forecasting Agent provides probabilistic volume distributions enabling risk-aware production planning. This integration supports three waste reduction mechanisms:

1. **Design for Demand Certainty**: Materials/styles with higher demand predictability enable confident larger production runs
2. **Make-to-Order Viability Assessment**: Evaluates whether premium pricing justified by sustainability story can offset longer lead times
3. **Modular Design for Flexibility**: Recommends modular patterns enabling late-stage customization responsive to actual orders

# Case Study Demonstrations

We demonstrate the framework through three realistic design scenarios illustrating multi-objective optimization across different garment categories.

## Case Study 1: Jacket Design - Material Tradeoffs

**Design Context**: Mid-weight casual jacket, target price €120-150, planned volume 15,000 units.

**Material Options**:

**Option A: Organic Cotton Canvas** (Portugal)
- Carbon: 4.2 kg CO₂e, Water: 850 L, Cost: €18.50/m, Lead time: 6 weeks
- Drape: Moderate (stiffer hand), Recycling: Excellent, Data confidence: High

**Option B: Recycled Polyester** (China)
- Carbon: 5.8 kg CO₂e, Water: 180 L, Cost: €12.20/m, Lead time: 12 weeks
- Drape: Superior, Recycling: Moderate, Data confidence: Medium

**Option C: Hemp-Cotton Blend** (France)
- Carbon: 3.1 kg CO₂e, Water: 520 L, Cost: €22.80/m, Lead time: 8 weeks
- Drape: Good, Recycling: Poor, Data confidence: High

**FAHP-TOPSIS Results**: Designer preferences (carbon 0.35, cost 0.25, aesthetic 0.25, lead time 0.10, water 0.05) yield:
1. Hemp-Cotton (0.78 ± 0.12): Lowest carbon aligns with heavy weighting
2. Organic Cotton (0.65 ± 0.08): Balanced, better data confidence
3. Recycled Polyester (0.52 ± 0.18): Superior drape offset by carbon and uncertainty

**Framework Insights**: Hemp-cotton scores highest, but sensitivity analysis reveals decision fragility: if cost weight increases to 0.35, organic cotton becomes preferred. Interactive Pareto frontier shows hemp-cotton dominates on carbon but cannot achieve recycled polyester's drape without design adaptation. Framework flags recycled polyester's wide confidence band (±0.18) due to unverified recycled content claim.

**Designer Decision**: Selects hemp-cotton, accepting aesthetic adaptation to achieve carbon leadership. Framework recommends pilot production (2,000 units) with organic cotton as fallback.

**Quantified Impact**: Hemp-cotton vs recycled polyester yields 2.7 kg CO₂e reduction × 15,000 units = **40.5 tons CO₂e savings**, equivalent to removing 8.7 passenger vehicles for one year. Water savings: 5.1 million liters.

## Case Study 2: Dress Design - Geographic Sourcing Optimization

**Design Context**: Summer dress, lightweight viscose, target price €80-100, planned volume 25,000 units.

**Geographic Options**:
- **Italian Mill**: 4.2 kg CO₂e total, €8.90/m, 4 weeks
- **Turkish Mill**: 5.8 kg CO₂e total, €6.50/m, 7 weeks
- **Indian Mill**: 8.0 kg CO₂e total, €4.20/m, 11 weeks

**Optimization Result**: Italian sourcing minimizes total carbon footprint despite higher cost. Demand forecasting agent identifies critical constraint: dress design has high trend sensitivity, making 11-week Indian lead time prohibitive regardless of cost savings—creating overproduction risk.

**Framework Recommendation**: Italian sourcing preferred, with carbon leadership supporting premium pricing strategy. Nearshoring reduces transport emissions and demand forecast uncertainty.

**Quantified Impact**: Italian vs Indian sourcing yields 3.8 kg CO₂e reduction × 25,000 units = **95 tons CO₂e savings**, while reducing overproduction risk.

## Case Study 3: Activewear - Performance vs. Sustainability Constraints

**Design Context**: Technical running shirt, moisture-wicking required, target price €45-60, planned volume 40,000 units.

**Material Options**:
- **Virgin Polyester**: Excellent performance, 7.2 kg CO₂e, €5.80/m
- **Recycled Polyester**: Good performance, 4.9 kg CO₂e, €6.40/m
- **Bio-Based Polyester**: Identical performance, 3.2 kg CO₂e, €8.90/m

**FAHP-TOPSIS with Performance Constraints**: Optimization configured with **hard constraint** (moisture wicking ≥ 90th percentile) plus soft preferences for carbon reduction and cost minimization.

**Result**: Bio-based polyester satisfies performance constraint (identical polymer properties) while achieving 56% carbon reduction versus virgin alternative. Framework identifies price premium (€3.10/m) as market positioning decision. Demand forecasting agent provides critical insight: activewear consumers demonstrate higher willingness-to-pay for environmental attributes (+18% price tolerance), suggesting premium pricing viable with transparent sustainability communication.

**Framework Recommendation**: Bio-based polyester with enhanced sustainability storytelling. DPP integration transforms environmental data from backend compliance record to front-end consumer value proposition.

**Quantified Impact**: Bio-based vs virgin polyester yields 4.0 kg CO₂e reduction × 40,000 units = **160 tons CO₂e savings**. Make-to-order production planning (enabled by shorter domestic supply chain) reduces overproduction waste by estimated 15% (6,000 units), saving additional 19.2 tons CO₂e.

# Discussion

## Implementation Challenges

**DPP Data Availability and Quality**: The framework's value proposition depends critically on comprehensive, high-quality environmental data accessible through DPP infrastructure. Current reality presents significant gaps: many suppliers lack verified LCA data, third-party certification remains incomplete, and data provenance uncertainty undermines designer confidence [Cruz et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/app15182592). The phased DPP deployment strategy—prioritizing post-sales services before comprehensive supply chain traceability—means design-stage environmental data will remain incomplete through late 2020s.

**Designer Workflow Disruption Risk**: Real-time LCA feedback introduces additional decision complexity into time-pressured design processes. Industrial CAD systems demonstrate that environmental feedback can enhance workflows when properly integrated, but fashion design operates under different constraints: tighter timelines, less technical user base, and aesthetic priority that may resist quantitative optimization. Our progressive disclosure interface addresses this through tiered complexity, though empirical validation with practicing designers remains necessary.

**Multi-Objective Optimization Complexity**: FAHP-TOPSIS methodology [Sharma et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmech.2025.1666571) assumes designer preferences can be meaningfully expressed as numerical weights. Creative decision-making often resists such quantification. The Pareto frontier presentation partially addresses this by visualizing tradeoff structure rather than imposing algorithmic decisions, though risk remains that optimization formalization constrains creative exploration.

**Validation Requirements**: Case studies demonstrate plausible carbon footprint reductions (20-56%) based on literature-derived material LCA data, but empirical validation requires production pilots comparing predicted versus actual environmental outcomes. Validating that LCA-optimized designs actually reduce total environmental harm requires system-level analysis tracking market-level effects.

**Cost-Benefit Uncertainty for SMEs**: Large fashion brands can readily adopt LCA-aware design frameworks, but SMEs face steeper barriers. Implementation requires CAD tool integration, DPP system access, staff training, and ongoing data management. The framework's modular architecture enables partial deployment, potentially lowering adoption barriers.

## Future Research Directions

6. **Federated Learning for Demand Forecasting**: Collaborative model training without centralizing sensitive data, potentially improving predictions while preserving competitive confidentiality
7. **Physical-Digital Integration**: Cost-effective physical verification methods validating DPP environmental claims through isotope ratio analysis, spectroscopy, and Bayesian knowledge graph architectures
8. **Global Sustainability Transitions**: Examining green transition challenges in developing economy contexts, addressing capacity-building initiatives and technology transfer programs [research examining textile manufacturing sustainability outside advanced economies reveals infrastructure gaps potentially creating two-tier landscape]

# Conclusion

The fashion industry confronts an urgent sustainability crisis requiring transformation from linear production models toward circular, environmentally conscious systems. While the EU's ESPR mandates Digital Product Passports by 2030, current design workflows treat environmental assessment as post-facto compliance checking rather than proactive optimization integrated into creative decision-making. This temporal disconnect forecloses opportunities for environmental impact reduction precisely when design modifications remain feasible.

This paper proposed an LCA-aware parametric design framework addressing this gap through multi-agent orchestration, leveraging verified DPP environmental data [Carvalho et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17051802), ML-based data quality assessment [Cruz et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/app15182592), and FAHP-TOPSIS multi-objective optimization [Sharma et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmech.2025.1666571); [Kousar et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.2591) to provide real-time sustainability feedback within existing CAD workflows. Virtual prototyping capabilities [Zhu & Liu 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17052102) enable multiple design iterations without consuming physical materials.

Case study demonstrations illustrated 20-56% carbon footprint reductions through informed material selection, geographic sourcing optimization, and waste reduction. These quantified impacts—95 tons CO₂e savings for a 25,000-unit dress production through nearshoring, 160 tons for 40,000-unit activewear through bio-based material adoption—demonstrate substantial environmental benefits achievable when sustainability optimization occurs at design stage.

Critical implementation challenges temper this potential: DPP data availability remains incomplete across supply chains, designer workflow integration demands exceptional interface usability, and empirical validation requires production pilots currently absent from literature. Future research priorities spanning industry pilots, designer workflow studies, CAD tool integration standards, and federated learning for demand forecasting outline a concrete agenda toward production-ready systems.

As regulatory pressure intensifies (textile waste destruction bans effective July 2026, full DPP mandates by 2030) and consumer demand for verified sustainability grows, competitive advantage will shift toward brands integrating environmental optimization into core design processes. The convergence of enabling technologies—AI-driven circular economy applications [Nisa et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/app15105691), digital transformation of textile manufacturing [Glogar et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42824-025-00167-8); [Ingle & Jasper 2025](https://doi.org/10.1177/00405175241310632), standardized PEF methodology [European Commission 2025](https://pefapparelandfootwear.eu/), and MCP-based supply chain orchestration [existing DPP/MCP paper]—creates unprecedented opportunity for proactive sustainability optimization in fashion design. Whether the industry seizes this opportunity will largely determine fashion's environmental trajectory toward 2030 and beyond.
