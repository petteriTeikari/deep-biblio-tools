# Digital Product Passports and the Model Context Protocol
## An Interoperability Intelligence Layer Operationalizing Global DPP Standards

# Abstract

The European Union's Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) mandates Digital Product Passports (DPPs) for fashion products by 2030, requiring comprehensive traceability across fragmented global supply chains characterized by heterogeneous data formats, multi-tier opacity, and severe technological divides. This review examines Multi-Agent Systems leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an interoperability intelligence layer operationalizing emerging global standards including UNECE's UN Transparency Protocol and GS1 EPCIS 2.0. We synthesize recent literature on: (1) agent architectures for supply chain orchestration, comparing centralized versus decentralized patterns; (2) MCP's role in standardizing LLM-tool interactions alongside complementary protocols (A2A, XAA, ANS); (3) memory architectures enabling extended supply chain workflows; (4) uncertainty quantification methods (conformal prediction, selective prediction, interpretable glass-box models) for regulatory compliance; (5) security vulnerabilities in  real-world MCP applications; and (6) physical-digital integration strategies addressing the oracle problem. While MCP-based architectures offer promising solutions to data heterogeneity challenges, critical production-readiness gaps constrain near-term deployment: security immaturity with attack success rates reaching 75-100%, limited standardization of orchestration patterns, and insufficient empirical validation in regulated environments. We identify research priorities spanning security hardening, production pilots with published metrics, uncertainty quantification benchmarking, and physical verification cost-benefit analyses, outlining a concrete research agenda for 2025-2030 toward production-ready agentic DPP systems.

# Introduction

### The Magnitude of the Crisis

The global textile and fashion industry confronts a systemic crisis encompassing ecological, economic, and social dimensions that threatens both environmental stability and the sector's long-term viability ([Niinimäki et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-020-0039-9); [Fletcher, 2016](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Craft-Use-Post-Growth-Kate-Fletcher/dp/1138021016)). The sector accounts for an estimated 10% of global anthropogenic carbon emissions ([Mayer and Tama Birkocak 2024](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-70262-4_5)) and consumes approximately 79 trillion liters of water annually ([Niinimäki et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-020-0039-9)), while generating substantial textile waste with minimal recycling rates for clothing-to-clothing applications. The prevailing linear model of production and consumption has created an unsustainable system marked by excessive resource consumption, massive waste generation, and supply chains whose opacity often conceals significant ethical violations ([Köksal et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.3390/su9010039)).

The economic inefficiencies extend beyond waste generation to include deliberate destruction of unsold inventory. Investigations reveal that major fashion brands routinely destroy significant quantities of unsold products annually ([BBC, 2018](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44885983)), with H&M's $4.3 billion inventory overhang in 2018 illustrating the profit-and-loss erosion cycle facing fast fashion retailers ([Bloomberg, 2018](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/h-m-profit-plunges-to-16-year-low-as-clothing-chain-loses-allure)). This destruction represents not merely product loss but the annihilation of all embedded resources, labor, and capital invested in their creation.

### Regulatory Response: The ESPR and DPP Mandate

In response to these systemic challenges, the European Union has enacted the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR), which entered into force in July 2024, dramatically expanding regulatory scope to encompass nearly all physical goods, with textiles identified as a high-priority product group for initial implementation ([European Commission, 2024](https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation_en)). The ESPR mandates the Digital Product Passport (DPP) as its central information tool, conceived as a comprehensive digital record containing detailed information about a product's sustainability, circularity, and value chain characteristics ([Adisorn et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/en14082289)). The regulation further strengthens its impact through direct economic interventions, including a ban on the destruction of unsold textiles for large enterprises beginning in July 2026 ([European Parliament, 2023](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room)), and an enhanced framework for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes that hold companies financially accountable for their products' entire lifecycle.

### Phased Deployment Strategy: Post-Sales First, Supply Chain Second

The fashion industry faces a fundamental strategic choice in DPP implementation: focusing primarily on **post-sales circular economy services** (repair, resale, recycling, waste collection) versus **comprehensive supply chain traceability** from raw materials through manufacturing. Industry practitioners and UN/CEFACT experts advocate a phased approach that prioritizes post-sales services as the initial implementation phase, then extends to upstream supply chain transparency as data availability and business requirements mature.

This phased strategy reflects practical realities: circular economy actors—recyclers, resellers, and repairers—require only minimal **core data** to deliver substantial value. A complete DPP enabling repair, resale, and recycling needs merely: (1) material composition of declaration groups (e.g., upper, lining, outer sole for footwear), (2) chemical management standards and certificates (e.g., ZDHC MRSL compliance, REACH conformity), (3) select raw material standards, (4) link to original product website, and (5) sale date. This limited dataset, already partially mandated by existing EU directives like shoe labeling requirements, enables immediate circular economy functionality with clear cost-benefit ratios and lower implementation complexity.

By contrast, comprehensive supply chain traceability demands **extended data** spanning dozens of tiers across multiple countries, engaging raw material producers, yarn manufacturers, fabric mills, garment factories, and brands—each with vastly different technological capabilities and data formats. While this extended data supports brand sustainability claims and regulatory due diligence requirements, its acquisition confronts formidable challenges including multi-tier opacity, heterogeneous data systems, and supplier reluctance to share commercially sensitive information. The phased approach acknowledges these realities: establish circular economy value first with minimal data, then incrementally expand to supply chain transparency as infrastructure matures and incentives align.

This deployment pattern has profound implications for DPP architecture and governance. Rather than requiring all stakeholders to immediately participate in comprehensive traceability platforms, the phased model enables **modular system evolution**: initial implementations serve post-sales use cases, with supply chain traceability capabilities added incrementally as data sources become available. Product lifecycle tracking emerges as a critical bridge between phases—capturing sale dates, resale events, repair transactions, and eventual recycling enables EPR tax calculations based on actual product lifespan rather than proxy metrics like fabric durability, while simultaneously building the data infrastructure necessary for upstream traceability integration.

### Global Standardization and the Interoperability Challenge

While the EU's ESPR represents the most comprehensive regulatory framework for DPPs, parallel initiatives from global standardization bodies reveal DPP implementation as a worldwide imperative. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), through UN/CEFACT, has developed extensive knowledge in the garment and footwear sector since 2019, progressing from initial traceability requirements through blockchain pilots to product circularity data frameworks and the emerging UN Transparency Protocol (UNTP) ([UN/CEFACT, 2024](https://spec-untp-fbb45f.opensource.unicc.org/)). The convergence of CENELEC, IEEE, DIN, NIST, ETSI, ANSI, and UNECE underscores both the universal recognition of DPP importance and the critical need for harmonization. As UNECE's Recommendation 49 "Transparency at Scale" emphasizes: "It is time to ensure that all DPP efforts come together rather than fragment."

Three foundational interoperability challenges underpin successful DPP deployment across this fragmented landscape:

**Standards-Based Verification Over Atomic Data**: Industry experience demonstrates that referencing established standards and third-party certificates proves more meaningful and cost-effective than collecting hundreds of individual data points. Chemical management standards like ZDHC Manufacturing Restricted Substance Lists encapsulate hundreds of CAS numbers with third-party verification, providing non-experts with comprehensible trust signals while reducing data collection burdens. Similarly, sustainability standards (WRAP, BCI, amfori BSCI) bundle multiple criteria (environment, labor rights, traceability) into verifiable certifications. DPP systems must therefore prioritize **standard references and certificate verification** over granular metric collection, leveraging existing certification infrastructure rather than creating parallel verification systems.

**Centralized Vocabulary Databases as Foundation**: The absence of standardized, sector-specific code lists for materials, processes, and certifications creates substantial data exchange costs through repetitive manual entry across disparate systems. As practitioners note, such vocabulary databases are "literally not existing" despite being "a crucial basic requirement for interoperability." The ITC Standards Map exemplifies the potential value, providing comparison across 1,650+ sustainability criteria, though significant gaps persist in manufacturing and product standards coverage. Addressing this vocabulary standardization challenge represents foundational infrastructure—enabling worldwide comparability of standards (critical for chemical management data essential to recycling), guaranteeing interoperability for both traditional B2B data exchange and modern web access, and reducing actual high data exchange costs. Vocabulary standardization must encompass both regulatory requirements (for cross-jurisdictional compliance understanding) and voluntary standards (for brand sustainability claims), with sector-independent data structures supporting multi-sector retailers and cross-sector learning.

**Semantic Interoperability for Sustainability Metrics**: While technical protocols address data exchange mechanics, fundamental harmonization of sustainability metrics remains incomplete. The same product sustainability metric (e.g., carbon footprint calculation methodology) may be modeled differently across ISO 14083, EU Product Environmental Footprint (PEF), and other standards, creating semantic fragmentation that undermines data comparability. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development emphasizes that "no need exists for new metrics but for harmonization," proposing alignment of existing metrics within global corporate accountability frameworks ([WBCSD, 2023](https://www.wbcsd.org/)), while GS1 notes that "only a standardised, organised and collaborative use of data will enable a sustainable transition to an authentic circular economy model" ([GS1, 2020](https://gs1.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Circular-Economy-Plan-1.pdf)). Industry recognition of this interoperability imperative is growing: the H&M Foundation's "From Signals to Systems Change" report introduces the Reimagined System Map, an open-source framework positioning transparency and shared infrastructure as prerequisites for achieving the fashion sector's net-zero targets ([H&M Foundation, 2025](https://hmfoundation.com/2025/10/22/from-signals-to-systems-change/)). DPP systems must enable automated translation between measurement frameworks while maintaining provenance chains documenting transformation logic and associated uncertainty.

## Technical Challenges and Research Gaps

The implementation of comprehensive DPP systems confronts formidable technical challenges arising from fundamental characteristics of global fashion supply chains. These networks exhibit notorious opacity, often spanning dozens of tiers across multiple countries with vastly different levels of technological maturity ([Kumar et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1108/SCM-10-2017-0336)). The resulting fragmentation creates systemic information asymmetry that severely impedes both traceability efforts and regulatory compliance initiatives.

The ground-level reality of supply chain operations presents a stark challenge to digital transformation aspirations. Analysis of Bangladesh's textile sector—a critical node in global fashion supply chains—reveals that the vast majority of supply chain data exists in fragmented digital and analog formats including messaging applications, spreadsheets, and paper documents ([Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, 2024](https://www.bangladeshworkersafety.org)). The sector's informal manufacturing facilities, estimated to employ millions of workers operating outside formal tracking systems, process orders through basic digital communication platforms. This digital divide is compounded by language barriers requiring content localization across multiple languages throughout the Asia Garment Hub, including Bengali, Burmese, Chinese, Hindi, Khmer, Sinhalese, Urdu, and Vietnamese ([Asia Garment Hub, 2024](https://asiagarmenthub.net)).

The Rana Plaza disaster provides a sobering case study of supply chain opacity. Despite absence of official contracts, investigators found products from 29 global brands in the collapsed facility, revealing extensive unauthorized subcontracting chains invisible to corporate tracking systems ([NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, 2015](https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/rana-plaza)). Current industry assessments indicate that only a small percentage of major fashion brands can identify their deeper-tier suppliers, while various oversight mechanisms cover limited portions of actual manufacturing facilities, leaving significant portions effectively invisible to monitoring systems ([Fashion Revolution, 2023](https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/transparency/)).

The heterogeneity of data formats across supply chains compounds these challenges significantly. Critical information exists in myriad forms, from PDF invoices and scanned certification documents to proprietary ERP systems and spreadsheet-based quality assessments ([Garcia-Torres et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1108/SCM-04-2018-0152)). Existing implementation proposals often default to monolithic, centralized platforms that risk creating new data silos while encountering resistance from suppliers reluctant to share commercially sensitive information ([Pasdar et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1145/3567582)).

A critical yet underappreciated challenge involves the semantic interoperability of sustainability data itself. While technical protocols address data exchange mechanics, fundamental harmonization of sustainability metrics remains incomplete: the same product sustainability metric (e.g., carbon footprint calculation methodology) may be modeled differently across ISO 14083, EU Product Environmental Footprint (PEF), and other standards, creating semantic fragmentation that undermines data comparability (see Introduction for detailed discussion of this challenge).

Furthermore, the absence of centralized, sector-specific vocabulary databases—encompassing both regulatory and voluntary standards with standardized code lists for materials, processes, and certifications—creates substantial data exchange costs through repetitive manual entry across disparate systems. The ITC Standards Map exemplifies the potential value of such reference databases, though significant gaps persist in coverage of manufacturing and product standards ([ITC, 2024](https://www.standardsmap.org)). Addressing this vocabulary standardization challenge represents a foundational requirement for interoperability, potentially reducing data exchange costs while enabling worldwide comparability of standards—particularly critical for chemical management data essential to recycling processes.

## Research Scope and Thesis

This review examines how intelligent agent systems can operationalize emerging global DPP standards by addressing dynamic orchestration challenges inherent in fashion's fragmented, multi-tier supply chains. We position agent-based architectures not as alternatives to UNECE's UN Transparency Protocol (UNTP), GS1 EPCIS 2.0, or ISO's Product Circularity Data Sheet (PCDS), but rather as **complementary interoperability intelligence layers** that enable these standards to function in practice. While global standards provide governance frameworks, data models, and vocabulary specifications, agent systems provide runtime capabilities for context-aware coordination, adaptive data harmonization across evolving supplier networks, and cognitive automation of verification workflows—addressing gaps that static schemas alone cannot solve.

The convergence of recent advances in AI-powered agent systems with emerging protocols for standardized agent communication presents a promising architectural paradigm for DPP implementation. Specifically, we examine how these systems can support the phased deployment strategy by enabling modular evolution from core post-sales functionality to extended supply chain transparency, facilitate standards-based verification through automated certificate validation and compliance checking, populate and maintain centralized vocabulary databases through collaborative curation, and enable semantic interoperability by translating between sustainability measurement frameworks while tracking provenance and uncertainty. While agent-based architectures offer substantial promise, realistic deployment timelines demand caution: as [Karpathy (2025)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXUZvyajciY) observes, we face "the decade of agents, not the year of agents"—a perspective reinforced by recent empirical research documenting how sophisticated agent architectures amplify vulnerability to cascading failures where single errors propagate through subsequent decisions ([Song et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25370)), systematic multi-agent coordination failures across specification and verification dimensions ([Cemri et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13657)), agent-environment interaction failures limiting practical deployment success rates ([Song et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19504)), and security vulnerabilities with 75-100% attack success rates in real-world MCP deployments ([Zhao et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24272)). The fashion industry's 2030 DPP mandate aligns fortuitously with this decadal maturation timeline.

This review synthesizes recent literature across six domains critical to DPP implementation:

1. **Agent Architectures for Supply Chain Orchestration (Section 3)**: Examining how agent coordination patterns enable phased deployment—starting with simple post-sales workflows involving recyclers, repairers, and resellers, then scaling to complex multi-tier supply chain orchestration as extended data requirements mature.

2. **Standardized Agent Communication Protocols (Section 4.1)**: Analyzing emerging protocols for agent-tool interactions and agent-to-agent communication, evaluating their suitability for federated DPP architectures where no single entity controls all data sources or verification processes.

3. **Memory and Context Management (Section 4.2)**: Reviewing approaches for maintaining product-centric event histories across extended lifespans—from initial sale through repair, resale, and eventual recycling—essential for EPR compliance and circular business model support.

4. **Uncertainty Quantification for Regulatory Compliance (Section 4.3)**: Examining methods for providing formal guarantees when agent systems make claims about product sustainability, material composition, or supply chain provenance—critical for regulatory acceptance and legal liability management.

5. **Security and Trust Engineering (Section 5)**: Assessing vulnerabilities in agent-based systems and defensive architectures necessary for protecting commercially sensitive supply chain data while enabling necessary transparency for regulators and consumers.

6. **Physical-Digital Integration (Section 6)**: Analyzing technologies for verifying that digital DPP claims accurately represent physical product reality—the "oracle problem"—through authentication technologies, economic models for verification cost allocation, and strategies for sparse sampling that balance cost against assurance.

7. **Future Research Directions (Section 7)**: Identifying critical gaps including empirical validation needs, cross-industry applications beyond fashion, and architectural patterns for global-regulatory DPP integration.

Through this synthesis, we aim to inform both technical implementation decisions and policy frameworks, providing actionable knowledge for stakeholders navigating DPP deployment in the fashion sector and beyond.

### Key Contributions

This review makes five principal contributions to the field:

First, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of MCP applicability to fashion DPP systems, examining how this emerging protocol ([Anthropic, 2024](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture)) compares to alternative interoperability approaches including Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication ([Google, 2024](https://developers.google.com/agent-to-agent)), Agent Name Service (ANS) identity resolution, and Cross-App Access (XAA) authorization frameworks ([Okta, 2025](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2025/09/03/cross-app-access)). Through systematic comparison, we analyze trade-offs in centralized versus decentralized orchestration patterns ([Wang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13178); [Zhang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10762)) and their implications for ESPR compliance in federated supply chain environments.

Second, we synthesize recent research on memory architectures for multi-agent systems, comparing designs ranging from simple context-window approaches to complex five-tier hierarchies incorporating short-term, working, long-term, episodic, and consensus memory layers ([Han et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13178); [Park et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442)). We review continual learning strategies that enable agents to improve from experience without model weight updates ([Zhang et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04618v1)) and analyze context engineering approaches for managing extended supply chain verification workflows ([Anthropic, 2025](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents)).

Third, we compare Agent Cards (A2A specification) with proposed MCP Server Card concepts, analyzing their complementary roles in enterprise governance and regulatory transparency. We examine whether MCP Server Cards represent novel contributions or applications of existing Agent Card patterns to the tool layer, providing clarity on standardization pathways for agentic systems in regulated industries.

Fourth, we synthesize recent security research on MCP vulnerabilities, reviewing comprehensive empirical studies analyzing real-world MCP applications ([Zhao et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24272); [Guo et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12538)) and comparing defense mechanisms including MCP-Guard ([Xing et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10991)), MI9 runtime governance ([Wang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858)), MCPSecBench ([Yang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13220)), and capability-based sandbox to mitigate prompt injection attacks in LLM agents ([Tallam & Miller, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22852)). This synthesis reveals critical gaps in production-readiness for enterprise deployment.

Fifth, we survey uncertainty quantification methods for agentic systems in regulatory contexts, comparing conformal prediction approaches providing distribution-free coverage guarantees ([Angelopoulos & Bates, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07511)), selective prediction methods enabling strategic abstention, and interpretable glass-box models (EBM, NAM, M-GAM) offering inherent transparency. We analyze M-GAM's ([McTavish et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02646)) particular relevance for DPP systems due to its robustness to missing data—endemic in real-world supply chains.

# Background and Related Work

Having outlined the scope and contributions of this review, we now establish the foundation for understanding DPP implementation challenges by examining regulatory requirements, existing technological approaches, and architectural paradigms that inform agent-based solutions.

## The Digital Product Passport: Regulatory Requirements and Technical Foundations

The Digital Product Passport (DPP) )represents the central information infrastructure mandated by the ESPR, functioning as a comprehensive digital twin that accompanies products throughout their lifecycle ([Durão et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01614-2_19), [Wagner and Kabalska 2023](https://doi.org/10.1002/sd.2474), [Bi et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2025.2496840)). The system links physical products to their digital records through data carriers such as QR codes or NFC tags, providing stakeholders with access to detailed information about sustainability metrics, material composition, repairability specifications, and provenance data.

The regulatory timeline establishes mandatory implementation for batteries beginning in 2027 ([European Commission, 2024](https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation_en)), with textiles and other high-impact sectors expected to follow by 2030\. The battery regulation serves as a template for subsequent sectors, requiring comprehensive documentation including carbon footprint calculations, recycled content percentages, and supply chain due diligence information ([European Commission, 2023](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023R1542), [Pistoia 2025](https://hdl.handle.net/10589/239975)).

### DPP Data Requirements and Tiered Access Model

The data requirements for DPPs encompass 16+ distinct categories with a sophisticated tiered access model designed to balance transparency with commercial confidentiality. Public access levels provide consumers with sustainability scores, care instructions, and recycling information. Restricted access serves supply chain partners with supplier identities, transaction data, and certification details. Confidential access reserves trade secrets, pricing information, and sensitive business intelligence for regulatory authorities only ([European Parliament, 2024](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes); [CIRPASS, 2024](https://cirpassproject.eu/results/)).

A crucial architectural decision embedded in the ESPR is the mandate for decentralized data storage ([García et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15758), [Paolucci et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2024.12.030), [Kannappan et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1109/NTMS65597.2025.11076730)). While a central EU registry will facilitate DPP discovery and lookup, the actual data remains under control of individual economic operators. This federated model achieves several critical objectives simultaneously: avoiding single points of failure, enabling granular access control based on stakeholder permissions, and reducing resistance from suppliers concerned about commercially sensitive information.

### Interoperability Standards: The GS1 Imperative

The success of the DPP ecosystem fundamentally depends on achieving true interoperability across diverse systems and stakeholders. GS1 EPCIS 2.0 is emerging as the mandatory interoperability standard for DPP implementation, with GS1 Digital Link structuring URLs with GTINs/GLNs for product lookup ([GS1, 2024a](https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis)). Organizations building on proprietary identifiers face immense scaling challenges—adoption of GS1 standards represents not merely a technical implementation detail but a strategic imperative for ecosystem participation ([Sigma Technology, 2024](https://sigmatechnology.com/dpp-analysis)).

The CIRPASS (Collaborative Initiative for a Standards-based Digital Product Passport) project has emerged as the primary force for establishing conceptual and technical foundations for cross-sectoral DPP implementation ([CIRPASS, 2024](https://cirpassproject.eu/results/)). This Horizon Europe-funded initiative brought together 31 partners from industry, research institutions, and standardization bodies to develop a comprehensive framework including a sophisticated data model covering over 200 attributes, detailed reference implementation guidelines for three priority sectors, and an open-source software toolkit for accelerated implementation.

The successor project, CIRPASS-2, has shifted focus from conceptual development to practical validation, deploying functioning DPPs at scale through real-world pilots with major brands including H\&M, Zalando, and Inditex ([Fashion United, 2024](https://fashionunited.com/news/business/h-m-zalando-join-eu-digital-product-passport-pilot)). These pilots provide crucial empirical validation of the framework's viability while identifying implementation challenges that only emerge at scale.


### Standards-Based Verification: Encapsulation vs. Atomization

A critical architectural decision in DPP data models concerns granularity: whether to represent sustainability characteristics through references to established standards and certifications, or through atomized individual data points. Industry practitioners argue compellingly that standards-based approaches offer substantial advantages over granular data enumeration. Chemical management exemplifies this principle: rather than listing hundreds of individual CAS (Chemical Abstracts Service) numbers, DPPs can reference comprehensive standards such as ZDHC (Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals) Manufacturing Restricted Substance Lists or REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) regulations. These standards encapsulate extensive criteria subject to third-party verification, providing greater semantic clarity to non-expert stakeholders while reducing data payload sizes.

Furthermore, standards-based references enable dynamic updates as regulatory requirements evolve, avoiding the brittleness of hard-coded data specifications that become obsolete as scientific understanding advances or regulatory thresholds tighten. The ITC Standards Map demonstrates the value of centralized standard reference databases, profiling voluntary sustainability standards (e.g., Better Cotton Initiative, WRAP, AMFORI BSCI) with their respective criteria spanning environmental performance, social/labor rights, quality management, and due diligence ([ITC, 2024](https://www.standardsmap.org)). However, significant gaps persist: most manufacturing and product standards remain absent from existing reference databases, and understanding compliance requirements across different national legislation requires substantial manual research. Addressing this gap through comprehensive, globally accessible standard reference databases represents a critical infrastructure investment for DPP interoperability, enabling guaranteed interoperability for classic B2B EDI data transfer while supporting worldwide comparability of standards—particularly critical for chemical management data essential to recycling.

The architectural implication for multi-agent DPP systems is significant: rather than agents extracting and validating hundreds of individual data points, they can verify standard compliance through certified assessments and accreditation chains. This standards-based approach aligns naturally with hierarchical agent architectures where specialized verification agents interact with certification bodies and accreditation databases, while orchestrator agents compose these verified standards into comprehensive compliance profiles. The shift from atomized data validation to standards-based verification may substantially reduce computational overhead and improve reliability, as third-party certification processes already incorporate quality assurance mechanisms that would otherwise require replication in automated validation pipelines.

## Agentic AI and Multi-Agent Architectures

The evolution from single-shot Large Language Model interactions to autonomous agentic systems represents a fundamental paradigm shift in artificial intelligence applications ([Xi et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07864), [Schneider 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18875), [Yao et al., 2025](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10991)). These agents possess the capability to perceive their environment, reason about observations, formulate plans, and execute actions iteratively to accomplish complex goals.

In supply chain contexts, agentic AI enables dynamic orchestration of disparate data sources, software tools, and human actors, transforming how organizations manage both routine operations and unexpected disruptions ([Vann Yaroson et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-025-06534-7), [IBM Institute for Business Value (2025)](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/supply-chain-ai-automation-oracle)). Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) address the inherent complexity of these environments by distributing intelligence among specialized agents, each responsible for specific domains or capabilities. This approach mirrors established software engineering practices for managing complex systems through modularization and separation of concerns ([Zhang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10762)).

Recent research reveals that relatively simple ensembling methods account for substantial performance gains in multi-agent systems ([Choi et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17536)). Majority voting and similar aggregation strategies often provide most of the benefit from multi-agent approaches ([Choi et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17536)), with more complex debate mechanisms adding marginal value beyond basic voting in many scenarios ([Rui Ai et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01499)). For DPP orchestration contexts, uncertainty-weighted voting strategies where orchestrators weight agent contributions by confidence scores may prove more effective than unweighted aggregation ([Meyen et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00039), [Gasparin and Ramdas 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09379)), though empirical validation in supply chain environments remains an important area for future research.

A critical challenge for MAS in supply chain contexts involves maintaining three levels of context alignment: overall system-wide goals (e.g., DPP compliance for entire supply chain), individual agent-specific responsibilities (e.g., verify Tier-3 cotton provenance), and inter-agent context from collaborating agents ([Han et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13178)). This layered context requirement necessitates robust communication protocols and shared semantic understanding.

## **The Model Context Protocol Ecosystem**

The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in late 2024, provides a standardized interface for how AI models interact with external tools and data sources ([Anthropic, 2024](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture)). Unlike traditional approaches requiring bespoke API integrations for each tool or service, MCP provides a universal interface layer that dramatically simplifies both development and maintenance of AI-powered systems. The protocol architecture consists of three primary components: clients (typically AI models or agent frameworks), servers (exposing tools and data sources through standardized interfaces), and the tools themselves (actual functionalities ranging from data queries to complex operations).

The proliferation of agentic systems from different vendors has created additional interoperability challenges addressed by complementary protocols:

* **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** establishes communication standards built on JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S), with dynamic discovery through Agent Cards ([Google, 2024](https://developers.google.com/agent-to-agent))
* **Agent Name Service (ANS)** provides DNS-like identity resolution with cryptographic verification ([Huang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10609))
* **Agent Capability Negotiation and Binding Protocol (ACNBP)** enables dynamic capability discovery and service agreement negotiation ([Huang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13590))
* **Cross-App Access (XAA)** provides OAuth 2.0/SAML-based authorization with context-aware permissions and temporal access control, enabling fine-grained access management across heterogeneous agent applications ([Okta, 2025](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2025/09/03/cross-app-access))

The relationship between these protocols is fundamentally complementary rather than competitive  ([Petrova et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10644), [Liao et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21105)). A2A governs agent-to-agent orchestration and discovery, ANS provides identity infrastructure for agent networks, ACNBP establishes contractual frameworks for capability exchange, and MCP operates at the execution layer enabling individual agents to access tools and data sources. This layered architecture provides both flexibility needed for innovation and structure required for enterprise governance.

However, critical questions remain regarding standardization convergence. The concept of Agent Cards (A2A specification) provides agent-level metadata including capabilities, authentication requirements, and endpoints ([Google, 2024](https://developers.google.com/agent-to-agent)). Proposed MCP Server Cards would extend this pattern to the tool layer, providing detailed documentation of data integrity guarantees, access control models, audit trail specifications, and regulatory alignment. Whether these represent complementary standards or overlapping proposals requiring consolidation remains an open question requiring community resolution.

**MCP and UNTP: Complementary Layers in the DPP Technology Stack**

The relationship between MCP and UNECE's UN Transparency Protocol (UNTP) merits explicit clarification, as both address interoperability yet operate at different architectural layers. UNTP establishes **data layer standards** for DPP content representation, including vocabulary specifications aligned with UN/CEFACT's Sustainable Development and Circular Economy (SDCE) reference data model, trust mechanisms through Verifiable Credentials (W3C VC standard), identity infrastructure via Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and data exchange protocols using RESTful APIs with standardized authentication ([UN/CEFACT, 2024](https://spec-untp-fbb45f.opensource.unicc.org/)).

In contrast, MCP operates at the **orchestration layer**, providing dynamic tool discovery and invocation enabling agents to interact with heterogeneous DPP systems, context management for maintaining coherent state across multi-step workflows, adaptive schema translation between sector-specific UNTP extensions, and cognitive automation through LLM-based reasoning over structured and unstructured product data.

This layered architecture enables flexible deployment scenarios: organizations can implement UNTP-compliant DPP systems using traditional integration approaches (point-to-point APIs, ESB middleware) *or* leverage MCP-based agentic architectures for enhanced automation and adaptability. The MCP layer remains agnostic to underlying data standards—agents interact with UNTP-compliant systems, legacy ERP platforms, blockchain networks, or hybrid architectures through standardized tool interfaces.

## **Blockchain Initiatives and Their Limitations**

The application of blockchain technology to supply chain transparency has generated significant interest and investment, with several prominent initiatives attempting to address textile traceability challenges ([Qiao et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcra.2024.100266), [Hader et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jii.2022.100345)). However, empirical evidence reveals fundamental limitations that constrain blockchain's effectiveness in isolation  ([Najat, 2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/fbloc.2025.1503595)).

The oracle problem—the inability of blockchain systems to independently verify that off-chain data accurately represents physical reality—represents a fundamental challenge for supply chain applications ([Teoh, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0123942), [Caldarelli et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1108/JOCM-09-2020-0299)). While blockchain can ensure immutability and cryptographic verification of recorded data, it cannot verify the accuracy of initial data entry or continued correspondence with physical goods. A supplier's blockchain-recorded claim of "organic cotton from Uzbekistan" is cryptographically verifiable as their claim, but not as ground truth (see Section 6 for detailed analysis of physical-digital integration strategies addressing this challenge).

High-profile failures underscore these limitations. Various blockchain-based traceability initiatives have encountered challenges ranging from limited adoption to operational difficulties, though comprehensive post-mortem analyses examining failure modes remain sparse in academic literature. Paradoxically, low-technology solutions often prove more effective  ([Jack and Suri, 2014](http://doi.org/10.1257/aer.104.1.183), [Lustenberger and Spychiger 2025](https://doi.org/10.1108/SCM-03-2024-0192)), and physical markers embedded in fibers provide indestructible verification surviving washing and dyeing processes—achieving through chemistry what blockchain cannot through cryptography alone ([FibreTrace, 2024](https://fibretrace.io)).

Recent academic research on smart contract vulnerabilities reveals additional concerns. Smart contracts—often touted as enabling automated, trustless verification—have demonstrated significant security vulnerabilities including reentrancy attacks, access control failures, and arithmetic errors  ([Iuliano and Di Nucci 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01719), [Sadaf et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-025-10646-w)). Security challenges in decentralized systems extend to multi-agent architectures as well (see Section 5 for comprehensive security analysis). The polarized discourse around web3 technologies, with critics characterizing many applications as "marketing slogans" lacking substantive innovation, suggests caution in blockchain adoption for DPP systems absent clear evidence of value over simpler alternatives  ([Winecoff and Lenhard 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10222), [Calzada 2025](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5227972)).

## **Federated Learning for Supply Chain Data Privacy**

Federated Learning (FL) represents a transformative paradigm for collaborative machine learning that enables multiple supply chain participants to jointly train models without exchanging raw data, addressing fundamental privacy concerns while extracting collective intelligence from distributed datasets ([Yao et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2024.3407584); [Zhang et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIV.2023.3332675)). The methodology has gained particular traction in supply chain applications where data sharing barriers—stemming from competitive concerns, regulatory constraints, and proprietary information protection—historically prevented collaborative optimization ([Li et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2024.2432469); [Zhou et al., 2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-023-05477-1)). For DPP implementation contexts, FL presents compelling advantages: supply chain members can collectively improve predictive models for demand forecasting, risk assessment, or quality control while maintaining local data sovereignty, with only model parameters or gradients exchanged rather than sensitive transactional data ([Song et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.10691v1)).

The architectural evolution from centralized to decentralized FL frameworks proves particularly relevant for federated DPP systems ([Yao et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2024.3407584); [Zhang et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIV.2023.3332675)). Centralized FL employs a parameter server aggregating updates from participating clients, introducing potential bottlenecks and single points of failure incompatible with ESPR's decentralized data storage mandate ([Yao et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2024.3407584)). Decentralized FL (DFL) architectures eliminate central servers through peer-to-peer communication protocols, enabling direct client-to-client model exchange that aligns more naturally with federated supply chain networks ([Yao et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2024.3407584); [Song et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.10691v1)). Recent advances in privacy-preserving DFL demonstrate formal differential privacy guarantees while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices common in manufacturing environments, with implementations achieving substantial accuracy improvements over non-federated baselines while reducing training time and energy consumption by orders of magnitude ([Song et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.10691v1)).

Critical research demonstrates FL's viability for supply chain-specific applications including risk prediction, relationship discovery in knowledge graphs, and closed-loop decision optimization ([Li et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2024.2432469); [Chen et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.07231v1); [Zhou et al., 2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-023-05477-1)). Graph Convolutional Neural Networks combined with FL enable supply chain visibility enhancement through relationship prediction in knowledge graphs without raw data exchange, facilitating proactive risk management while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations ([Chen et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.07231v1)). Manufacturing sector applications span quality prediction, equipment maintenance, and product lifecycle management, with FL emerging as an enabling technology for Industry 5.0's vision of resilient, human-centric, sustainable manufacturing systems ([Wang et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2025.103179)). However, significant challenges persist including data heterogeneity across participants with non-IID distributions, communication overhead in bandwidth-constrained environments, and the need for robust incentive mechanisms to ensure sustained participation—issues that proposed data pricing frameworks and adaptive network formation algorithms begin to address ([Li et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2024.2432469); [Zhang et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1145/3690624.3709346)).

## **Business Model Innovation in DPP Implementation**

Beyond regulatory compliance, DPP systems along with circular economy in fashion, present significant business model innovation opportunities ([Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2021](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/our-vision-of-a-circular-economy-for-fashion), [Pal and Gander, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.001), [Konietzko et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122596), [Fu et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-023-03943-1)). Graduated implementation models make DPP accessible for small and medium enterprises through modular, pay-per-use architectures. Various providers offer solutions at accessible price points, with some providing free basic tiers and credit programs supporting MSME adoption. These models acknowledge that incremental improvement surpasses perfect compliance, transforming DPP costs from capital expenditure to operational expenditure.

Digital product identity platforms, which [EON](https://www.eon.xyz/) conceptualizes as 'CRM for Products,' demonstrate commercial viability beyond mere compliance ([Alcayaga et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.085), [Novak and Hoffman 2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11747-018-0608-3), [Raff et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12544)). By transforming products into ongoing service platforms post-purchase, platforms enable brands to enhance customer relationships through ongoing engagement. Adopters focus on consumer-facing benefits  ([Grönroos and Voima, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11747-012-0308-3), [D'Adamo et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19255-2), [Petäinen et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1007/s43615-024-00351-z), [Wang et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2025.2456991)) —improved resale markets, personalized care instructions, repair guidance—rather than demanding complete supply chain transparency, which remains aspirational for most organizations.

# Comparative Review of DPP Architectures

With the regulatory landscape, technological alternatives, and business model innovations now established, we turn to the architectural question central to this review: how can multi-agent systems operationalize DPP requirements across fragmented supply chains? This section examines competing architectural paradigms and identifies the integration challenges that agent-based solutions must address.

## Architectural Paradigms: Centralized vs. Decentralized Approaches

DPP implementations must navigate fundamental architectural trade-offs between centralization and decentralization, monolithic and microservices designs, and standardized versus custom integration patterns. This section reviews proposed architectural paradigms and analyzes their suitability for regulated supply chain contexts.

Centralized platforms offer simplified governance and unified data access but create single points of failure and raise data sovereignty concerns ([Pasdar et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1145/3567582)). Organizations operating centralized DPP platforms must address scalability bottlenecks as the number of participants grows, manage concentration of liability and regulatory burden, and overcome supplier resistance to sharing commercially sensitive data with potentially competitive parties. Despite these challenges, centralized approaches provide clear advantages for early-stage deployment: simplified coordination protocols, unified user experience, and reduced technical complexity for participating organizations.

Decentralized architectures distribute data custody across stakeholders, aligning with ESPR's federated storage mandate where "the actual data remains under control of individual economic operators" while a central registry facilitates discovery ([EU Regulation 2024/1781](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R1781)). This approach addresses data sovereignty concerns critical for supplier participation ([Opriel et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12599-024-00893-4)), eliminates single points of failure improving system resilience, and enables heterogeneous technology choices across participants. However, decentralized systems introduce verification and auditability complexity, require sophisticated coordination mechanisms, and face challenges ensuring data quality and consistency across autonomous nodes ([Wang et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63076-8_11), [Ye et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04845), [Zheng et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2024.2432469)).

Microservices-based designs reduce coupling and enable independent scaling ([Newman, 2021](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-microservices-2nd/9781492034018/), [Zimmermann et al. 2022](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-API-Design-Simplifying-Addison-Wesley/dp/0137670109), with empirical studies suggesting up to 60% complexity reduction versus monolithic approaches ([Zhang et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1145/3589334.3645678)). The architectural pattern decomposes functionality into independently deployable services communicating via well-defined APIs, enabling teams to develop, deploy, and scale components autonomously. For DPP systems, microservices align naturally with supply chain structure: separate services for data ingestion, verification, aggregation, access control, and presentation can evolve independently while maintaining system coherence.

 However, microservices introduce significant orchestration challenges, network latency overhead, and operational complexity requiring sophisticated DevOps practices ([Newman, 2021](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-microservices-2nd/9781492034018/), [Nogueira et al. 2024](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.10434), [Bogner et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSA59870.2024.00023)). Testing microservices presents unique challenges distinct from other architectural patterns ([Hui et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2024.112232)). Performance engineering for microservices requires new approaches that explicitly account for their architectural particularities, including performance-aware testing, monitoring, and modeling challenges arising from container-based virtualization and orchestration solutions ([Heinrich et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1145/3053600.3053653)). These complexities are compounded in distributed DPP systems where service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance must be managed across heterogeneous participants while maintaining data consistency and traceability requirements."

## The MxN Integration Problem and Protocol Standardization

The proliferation of heterogeneous data sources and agent types in supply chain contexts creates the classic MxN integration problem, where M agents requiring access to N tools necessitates M×N custom integrations, scaling quadratically and creating unsustainable maintenance burdens. Protocol standardization addresses this by introducing a common interface layer that reduces integration complexity from O(M×N) to O(M+N), as each agent and tool needs only implement a single standardized interface. While this achieves linear rather than quadratic scaling, the approach eliminates only interface integration overhead—semantic harmonization for comparable outputs remains a separate challenge (see Section 3.3), and protocol evolution must be managed carefully to avoid fragmentation ([Newman, 2021](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-microservices-2nd/9781492034018/)).

## Data Harmonization: Schema Alignment and Semantic Integration

While MCP provides a standardized interface layer—analogous to USB-C for LLMs—it does not address semantic data harmonization challenges. The protocol handles tool discovery, invocation, and response formatting, but assumes tools already produce semantically consistent outputs. Data harmonization requires additional processing layers addressing schema alignment, unit conversion, quality validation, and drift monitoring.

Recent research on schema harmonization for heterogeneous data sources reveals several promising approaches. Ontology-based methods construct formal semantic models enabling automated mapping between disparate schemas ([Choi et al. 2006](https://doi.org/10.1145/1168092.1168097), [Anam et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1145/2843043.2843048), [Buss et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24716v1)). Machine learning approaches learn schema correspondences from example mappings, adapting to new data sources with minimal manual intervention ([Seedat & van der Schaar, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24105)). Hybrid approaches combining rule-based and learning-based methods achieve superior performance, particularly for complex many-to-many relationships common in supply chain data ([Sobolev & Stupnikov, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1134/S1054661825010145), [Ma et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08686)).

Distribution shift detection represents a critical capability for maintaining data quality over time. Supply chain data exhibits both gradual drift (evolving supplier practices, changing regulations) and sudden shifts (new suppliers, process changes). Recent advances in drift detection combine statistical tests with learned representations, achieving reliable detection with minimal false positives ([Zamzmi et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08088), [Arora et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1002/widm.1555)). Open-source frameworks such as Evidently AI and NannyML provide production-ready monitoring capabilities applicable to DPP contexts.

The field of ontology-based supply chain integration has seen significant development. [Ye et al. (2008)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220381679_An_ontology-based_architecture_for_implementing_semantic_integration_of_supply_chain_management) developed an ontology-based architecture using OWL DL for semantic integration of supply chain management. [Kulvatunyou & Ameri (2019)](https://www.nist.gov/publications/modeling-supply-chain-reference-ontology-based-top-level-ontology) propose a reference ontology based on the Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF) that addresses completeness, logical consistency, and accuracy gaps in existing supply chain ontologies. Multiple research efforts have formalized the SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference) model using ontological frameworks for process configuration and semantic interoperability.

Federated learning for data harmonization represents an emerging research direction (see Section 2.5). Rather than centralizing raw data for harmonization, federated approaches enable collaborative schema learning while preserving data locality ([Kokash et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20020)). Participants train local harmonization models on their data, sharing only model updates rather than raw data. This approach aligns naturally with supply chain confidentiality requirements while enabling collective improvement of harmonization quality.

## Document Processing and OCR for Supply Chain Documents

Supply chain documentation exists predominantly in unstructured formats—PDF invoices, scanned certificates, photographed labels, and handwritten shipping manifests—requiring sophisticated optical character recognition (OCR) and document understanding capabilities for data extraction. Recent advances in document AI have dramatically improved extraction accuracy, with layout-aware models that understand both textual content and spatial relationships achieving near-human performance on common document types ([Chen et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14442)), while multilingual capabilities supporting 100+ languages enable processing of documents from global manufacturing regions ([Sha et al. 2025](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.533/)). Commercial solutions like Reducto and open-source alternatives such as DOTS ( [github.com/rednote-hilab/dots.ocr](https://github.com/rednote-hilab/dots.ocr)) exemplify the maturation of these technologies for production deployment in supply chain contexts.

## Open Data Sources for Fashion Supply Chain Intelligence

Comprehensive DPP systems must integrate diverse external data sources providing context for verification, benchmarking, and enrichment. This section surveys publicly accessible databases, industry platforms, and research repositories relevant to fashion DPP implementation.

**📊 Table 2 \- Data Sources**

| Source | Type | Coverage | Access | Primary Use Cases | Data Quality |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [USDA Cotton & Wool Data](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/cotton-wool-and-textile-data) | Government | Global cotton production, trade, prices | Public | Raw material price verification, origin validation | High: Official statistics |
| [Open Supply Hub](https://opensupplyhub.org/) | Collaborative | 100K+ global apparel facilities | Open API | Supplier identification, facility verification | Medium: Crowdsourced, varies |
| [Textile Exchange LCI Library](https://textileexchange.org/lci-library/) | Industry Consortium | Life cycle inventory for fibers/processes | Member access | Carbon footprinting, environmental impact | High: Peer-reviewed data |
| [WRAP Textile Database](https://www.wrap.ngo/resources/tool/textiles-sorting-and-recycling-database) | NGO | UK recycling infrastructure | Public | End-of-life planning, circular economy | High: Curated data |
| [Reprex Textilebase](https://reprex.nl/observatories/textilebase/) | Research | EU textile market data | Open | Market analysis, trend identification | Medium: Aggregated statistics |
| [OS Circular Fashion](https://oscircularfashion.com/) | Open Source | Circular economy tools, methodologies | Open GitHub | Recycling pathway design, impact assessment | Varies: Community-driven |

Data quality and completeness issues plague these sources. Open Supply Hub, while comprehensive in facility coverage, relies on crowdsourced contributions with variable verification rigor—facility locations may be imprecise, ownership information outdated, and capability descriptions incomplete ([Mol 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.11.012), [Gardner et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.025), [Bari et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1080/17543266.2025.2529158)). Life cycle inventory data from Textile Exchange, though peer-reviewed, exhibits geographic bias toward European and North American production systems, with limited coverage of Asian processing methods dominant in global textile manufacturing ([Islam et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.05.144), [Wiedmann and Lenzen, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-018-0113-9).

Integration challenges include inconsistent entity identifiers (no universal supplier ID standard), temporal misalignment (data sources updated at different frequencies), and semantic heterogeneity (differing taxonomies for product categories, fiber types, and processing methods). Addressing these challenges requires sophisticated entity resolution, temporal alignment strategies, and ontology mapping—capabilities requiring dedicated development investment beyond basic data integration.

Governance and sustainability concerns merit attention. Open Supply Hub's crowdsourced model raises questions about long-term data quality maintenance, funding sustainability for the non-profit operator, and incentive alignment for contributors ([Sodhi and Wang, 2019]()https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13115). Industry consortium data (e.g., Textile Exchange) may exhibit selection bias if members systematically differ from non-members. Research-driven databases face updating frequency challenges as academic funding cycles don't align with industry data needs

## Orchestration Patterns: Centralized, Decentralized, and Hierarchical Approaches

Multi-agent DPP systems require sophisticated coordination mechanisms enabling agents to discover peer capabilities, delegate tasks appropriately, aggregate heterogeneous results, and resolve conflicts arising from competing objectives or contradictory data sources. Three primary orchestration paradigms emerge from distributed systems literature and multi-agent research, each presenting distinct trade-offs among scalability limits, fault tolerance properties, coordination complexity, and implementation difficulty ([Zhou et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02533v1)).

**Star topology** employs a single coordinator agent maintaining global system state and managing all inter-agent interactions, exemplified by frameworks including AutoGen and LangGraph ([Wang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13178)). This centralized orchestrator concentrates decision-making authority in a single node responsible for decomposing complex verification workflows into atomic subtasks, assigning these subtasks to specialized agents based on capability matching, monitoring task execution progress, and synthesizing partial results into coherent final outputs ([Zhang et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12508)). The pattern provides simplified coordination and clear responsibility assignment, enabling straightforward implementation of sophisticated coordination strategies and comprehensive audit trails supporting root cause analysis of failures. However, centralization introduces fundamental limitations: orchestrator unavailability immediately halts all system operations (single point of failure), coordination burden scales super-linearly as agent populations grow, and orchestrator complexity increases as the agent ecosystem evolves with new deployments and updates ([Gupta 2025](https://venturebeat.com/ai/beyond-single-model-ai-how-architectural-design-drives-reliable-multi-agent-orchestration)). Star topology proves most appropriate for small-to-medium DPP deployments where coordination simplicity outweighs scalability concerns, particularly during rapid prototyping and for scenarios requiring strong consistency guarantees such as financial reconciliation workflows.

**Mesh topology** eliminates the central coordinator, enabling agents to communicate directly through peer-to-peer protocols where each agent publishes capability descriptions via standardized Agent Cards and discovers peers through distributed registries ([Google, 2025](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/)). Task allocation occurs through distributed negotiation rather than centralized assignment, with agents querying service registries for capable peers and directly requesting task execution. This decentralized approach addresses centralized patterns' fundamental limitations: individual agent failures impact only direct communication partners rather than cascading system-wide, peer-to-peer interaction distributes coordination load across all participants enabling near-linear scalability to thousands of participants, and novel agent combinations can provide emergent functionality without explicit orchestrator programming. However, mesh coordination introduces complexity trade-offs including sophisticated distributed consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos), unexpected emergent behaviors difficult to predict and debug, expanded attack surfaces requiring security mechanisms at every inter-agent communication channel, and substantially increased monitoring and debugging difficulty requiring distributed logging and tracing infrastructure ([Wooldridge, 2009](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Introduction-MultiAgent-Systems-Second/dp/0470519460)). Mesh topology proves most appropriate for large-scale DPP systems (hundreds to thousands of agents) where scalability requirements exceed centralized coordination capacity, particularly in resilient deployments across geopolitically unstable regions and highly dynamic environments with frequent agent population fluctuations.

**Hierarchical topology** synthesizes centralized and decentralized patterns through multiple orchestration layers where high-level orchestrators coordinate agent groups while group-internal coordination employs either centralized or decentralized strategies ([Wooldridge, 2009](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Introduction-MultiAgent-Systems-Second/dp/0470519460), [Moore 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12683v1)). This recursive structure naturally maps to multi-tier supply chain topologies where brands coordinate first-tier suppliers, who in turn coordinate second-tier suppliers. Each layer implements appropriate coordination mechanisms for its scope: top-level orchestrators employ centralized control for strategic decision-making, mid-level coordinators use lightweight consensus protocols for tactical coordination, and individual agents interact peer-to-peer for operational task execution. Hierarchical topology provides balanced scalability through layered decomposition where each orchestrator manages a bounded number of direct subordinates, domain specialization enabling targeted optimization at appropriate abstraction levels, and natural organizational alignment mirroring both enterprise structures and supply chain topologies. However, hierarchy introduces unique challenges including critical layer boundary design where poor decomposition creates bottlenecks, inter-layer coordination overhead increasing latency as requests propagate through multiple levels, and potential inconsistency between layers due to communication delays or partition tolerance strategies. Hierarchical topology proves most appropriate for multi-tier supply chains exhibiting natural hierarchical structure, enterprise deployments with organizational boundaries, and hybrid cloud-edge architectures requiring both strong consistency for critical workflows and high availability for non-critical operations.

**Table: Orchestration Pattern Comparison Matrix**

| Dimension | Star (Centralized) | Mesh (Decentralized) | Hierarchical |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Max Agent Scale** | 1-50 agents | 100-1000+ agents | 10-500 agents |
| **Coordination Complexity** | Low | High | Medium |
| **Single Point of Failure** | Yes | No | Partial (per layer) |
| **Implementation Difficulty** | Low | High | Medium-High |
| **Debugging Difficulty** | Low | High | Medium |
| **Consistency Guarantees** | Strong | Eventual | Layer-dependent |
| **Scalability Pattern** | Vertical (orchestrator) | Horizontal (peers) | Mixed |
| **Fault Isolation** | Poor (global impact) | Excellent (local impact) | Good (layer-contained) |
| **Organizational Alignment** | Flat organizations | Distributed teams | Hierarchical enterprises |
| **Best Use Case** | Prototyping, small deployments | Large-scale, high-availability | Multi-tier supply chains |

Selecting appropriate orchestration patterns requires systematic evaluation of scale requirements (agent population size and growth trajectory), consistency needs (strong versus eventual consistency guarantees), fault tolerance priorities (acceptable failure modes and recovery time objectives), network topology characteristics (bandwidth limitations, latency distributions, partition probability), organizational context (existing enterprise architecture and team structure), and development constraints (available engineering expertise and maintenance capacity).

# Production Challenges for MCP-Based DPP Systems

While the architectural analysis in Section 3 demonstrates MCP's conceptual promise for addressing DPP integration challenges, theoretical elegance must confront operational reality. This section shifts from architectural possibilities to production constraints, examining the gap between MCP's design vision and its current maturity for enterprise deployment in regulated environments.

## MCP Limitations and Enterprise Adoption Barriers

The Model Context Protocol, while promising in conceptual design, faces legitimate concerns regarding maturity for production deployments in regulated industries. Recent comprehensive security audits analyzing 2,562 real-world MCP applications reveal concerning vulnerability patterns: network APIs affect 56.1% of servers (1,438 instances), system resources impact 48.3% (1,237 servers), file resources reach 23.9% (613 servers), and memory resources affect fewer than 1% (25 servers) though with potentially critical impact ([Zhao et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2025.mcp.taxonomy); [Li et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2025.mcp.privilege)). Comprehensive threat analysis and defense mechanisms are examined in Section 5.

The January 2025 disclosure of vulnerabilities in Figma's MCP server enabling arbitrary file access and potential system compromise underscores the gap between MCP's conceptual promise and production-grade security requirements ([DarkReading, 2025](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/figma-mcp-server-agentic-ai-compromise)). This incident, affecting a major enterprise software platform, demonstrates that even well-resourced organizations struggle to implement MCP securely in early protocol maturity stages.

**Table 3: MCP Attack Vector Taxonomy**

| Attack Vector | Description | Success Rate | Target | Defense Mechanisms | Citation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Direct Tool Injection** | Manipulate tool outputs to inject malicious content | 100% ASR (output manipulation) 94% ASR (metadata poisoning) | Tool results consumed by agents | Input validation, output sanitization, cryptographic signing | [Zhao et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24272) |
| **Preference Manipulation (MPMA)** | Insert persuasive language in metadata to bias agent tool selection | 75-100% ASR (simple phrases) 85% ASR (genetic algorithms) | Tool selection logic | Metadata verification, selection auditing, diversity requirements | [Wang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11154) |
| **Supply Chain Attacks** | Compromise dependencies or third-party services | 16.7% ASR (webpage poisoning) 48.5% ASR (malicious packages) 64.7% ASR (infectious templates) | Development and runtime dependencies | Dependency scanning, zero-trust registries, sandboxing | [Guo et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12538) |
| **Tool Squatting & Rug Pull** | Name collision attacks and abandoned malicious tools | TBD (emerging threat) | Tool discovery mechanisms | OAuth-enhanced tool definitions (ETDI), verification workflows | [Bhatt et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01333) |

Systematic testing across multiple attack vectors reveals measurable attack efficacy. Direct tool injection achieves 100% success through output manipulation in configurations lacking validation, while genetic-algorithm-enhanced preference manipulation maintains 85% average success rate ([Wang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2025.mpma)). The infectious attack pattern deserves particular attention—vulnerabilities spread virally when agents generate new tools based on compromised templates, achieving 64.7% success through contextual mimicry ([Guo et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12538)).

Inverse correlation between application popularity and dangerous API usage provides insight into security maturity. Low-popularity applications (0-10 GitHub stars) account for 1,837 total API calls to dangerous interfaces, while high-popularity applications (50,000+ stars) average only 1 API call ([Li et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2025.mcp.privilege)). This suggests community review acts as a natural quality filter, though relying solely on popularity for security assurance remains insufficient for regulated deployments.

## Context Engineering for Extended Supply Chain Workflows

Recent research emphasizes a shift from prompt engineering—optimizing isolated instructions—to context engineering: strategically managing the full context window including conversation history, retrieved documents, tool outputs, and memory systems ([Anthropic, 2025](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents)). For supply chain agents tracking multi-tier networks, effective context engineering determines whether agents can maintain coherent reasoning across extended verification workflows spanning dozens of suppliers and data sources.

Modern LLMs offer substantial context windows: GPT-4 Turbo provides 128K tokens, Claude 3 Opus/Sonnet offer 200K tokens, and Gemini 1.5 Pro enables 1M tokens with experimental 2M support. However, effective context utilization does not scale linearly with window size. Research on the "lost in the middle" phenomenon reveals that LLMs exhibit degraded performance on information located in the middle of long contexts, with retrieval accuracy dropping 10-30% for mid-context facts compared to information at beginning or end ([Liu et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1162/tacl_a_00638)). For DPP verification workflows requiring assembly of data from 20-50 sources across supply chain tiers, this degradation proves problematic. Critical verification facts—certificate validity, physical verification analysis results, supplier audit findings—may appear at arbitrary positions in accumulated context. Strategies for mitigating position bias include context reordering placing critical facts at context boundaries, explicit attention mechanisms highlighting key information, and hierarchical summarization reducing context length while preserving critical details.

Recent advances in alignment modeling and test-time scaling challenge the traditional approach of cramming comprehensive instructions into system prompts, as research demonstrates a "curse of instructions" where LLMs exhibit degraded performance when juggling numerous rules simultaneously ([Anthropic, 2025](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents)). Instead of monolithic prompts, contextually conditional guidelines load relevant instructions dynamically based on conversation state—for instance, refund handling rules activate only when customers mention returns, reducing cognitive load from 50+ rules to 3-4 contextually relevant ones. This approach, exemplified by frameworks like Parlant ([GitHub](https://github.com/emcie-co/parlant)), structures guidance as condition-action pairs that evaluate relevance before insertion into context. Beyond dynamic loading, test-time scaling techniques like Knowledge Flow Prompting ([Zhuang, 2025](https://github.com/EvanZhuang/knowledge_flow)) demonstrate how iteratively updating knowledge lists between inference rollouts enables models to overcome context limitations—achieving high accuracy on complex reasoning tasks by progressively distilling insights across attempts rather than relying on single-pass processing. For DPP verification workflows, these techniques combine powerfully: alignment modeling enables agents to maintain focus by loading supplier-specific validation rules only when processing relevant supply chain segments, while iterative knowledge refinement allows agents to build comprehensive understanding across multiple verification passes. Combined with techniques like selective context pruning, hierarchical summarization, and strategic positioning of critical facts at context boundaries, these methods ensure agents maintain coherent reasoning even when coordinating verification across dozens of suppliers and heterogeneous data sources, transforming intractable multi-tier verifications into manageable iterative processes.

Recent work further validates the modular approach to memory management. LEGOMem's procedural memory framework demonstrates that decomposing task trajectories into reusable units significantly improves multi-agent coordination in workflow automation ([Han et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04851)), while EgoMem's asynchronous processing architecture enables real-time adaptation to continuous data streams ([Yao et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11914)). For DPP systems processing heterogeneous supply chain data, these architectural patterns suggest that memory should be distributed across both orchestration and execution layers, with concept-level abstractions ([Ho et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04439)) enabling cross-supplier pattern recognition while instance-specific memory maintains audit trails for regulatory compliance

## Uncertainty Quantification for Regulatory Compliance

Regulatory compliance in DPP systems necessitates formal quantification of uncertainty in LLM-based agent predictions, enabling risk-based human oversight and auditable decision-making. However, uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models remains an active research challenge rather than a solved problem, with fundamental questions persisting regarding how to identify, measure, and decompose uncertainty in agentic systems ([Beigi et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20199); [Shorinwa et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05563)). This section surveys three complementary UQ paradigms applicable to supply chain verification contexts, highlighting their distinct capabilities and limitations for regulated DPP deployments.

### Conformal Prediction: Distribution-Free Coverage Guarantees

Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free coverage guarantees through calibration sets and nonconformity scoring functions, generating prediction sets mathematically guaranteed to contain true values with user-specified probability ([Angelopoulos & Bates, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1561/2200000101); [Vovk et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1007/b106715)). For DPP origin verification, CP produces prediction sets such as {Vietnam, Cambodia} with 95% coverage—the true origin lies within this set with 95% probability under exchangeability assumptions. User-specified coverage levels (e.g., 90%, 95%, 99%) permit precise calibration to regulatory risk tolerances, while black-box compatibility enables CP application to any base predictor, including proprietary LLM-based agents where internal access proves infeasible ([Angelopoulos et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14193); [Romano et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03222)).

However, CP implementation faces critical limitations in dynamic supply chain environments. The approach critically relies on the exchangeability assumption, requiring calibration and test data to be drawn from identical distributions ([Tibshirani et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06019); [Barber et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1214/23-AOS2276)). This assumption proves systematically violated in DPP contexts with data drift (see Section 3.3 on distribution shift detection) where supplier networks evolve, verification patterns shift seasonally, and regulatory requirements change over time. When applied to LLM-based verification agents, standard CP breaks down under domain shift, often leading to under-coverage and unreliable prediction sets that fail to achieve intended coverage guarantees ([Kumar et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18404); [Ye et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12794)). Domain shift proves pervasive because agents are typically calibrated on historical benchmark datasets but deployed in dynamic environments where input distributions evolve continuously ([Moreno-Torres et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2011.06.019); [Recht et al., 2019](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/recht19a.html), [Tripathi et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23464))—for instance, an agent calibrated on cotton origin claims from Southeast Asian suppliers may encounter systematically different patterns when African suppliers enter the network. The high-dimensional and unstructured nature of supply chain data exacerbates these challenges, as traditional covariate shift adaptation methods that estimate probability density ratios prove computationally intractable when dealing with LLM inputs ([Gendler et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1145/3736575)).

For DPP systems, promising applications include material origin verification through geographically-bounded prediction sets, certification validation where current approaches rely on binary authentication methods ([Agrawal et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2021.107130)) that could benefit from probability ranges quantifying confidence, and carbon footprint estimation where existing LCA approaches already use Monte Carlo simulations and pedigree matrices to generate uncertainty intervals ([Henriksson et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0121221); [Amazon, 2024](https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com))—though CP could provide formal coverage guarantees beyond current statistical approaches. However, high uncertainty scenarios generate large, potentially uninformative prediction sets (e.g., {Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh}) that complicate operational decision-making and may trigger mandatory human review under risk-based oversight frameworks.

### Selective Prediction and AURC Metrics

Selective prediction frameworks enable models to strategically abstain from predictions under uncertainty, guaranteeing accuracy targets on non-abstained cases at the cost of reduced coverage ([Geifman & El-Yaniv, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08500), [Chen et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11689), [Santosh et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18645)). By establishing confidence thresholds, agents achieve user-specified accuracy levels—for instance, 99% correctness on answered queries while responding to only 80% of verification requests—enabling graduated response strategies aligned with verification confidence. Recent methodological advances have strengthened selective prediction's theoretical foundations: Information-Lift Certificates compare model probability estimates against baseline distributions to guide abstention decisions with provably robust guarantees even under heavy-tailed distributions characteristic of language generation tasks ([Ferrando et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06884)), while Selective Conformal Uncertainty (SConU) employs significance testing to identify samples deviating from expected uncertainty distributions, managing miscoverage rates through statistical hypothesis testing frameworks ([Kumar et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15610)).

Area Under Risk-Coverage (AURC) metrics evaluate selective prediction system quality by integrating risk across coverage levels, providing single-value summaries of prediction-abstention trade-offs ([Fisch et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12527)). Lower AURC values indicate superior selective prediction performance—the model achieves low risk across broad coverage ranges, reflecting effective uncertainty calibration. In DPP deployments, AURC enables systematic comparison of agent performance across diverse verification tasks and facilitates longitudinal assessment tracking whether agent reliability improves or degrades as verification patterns evolve with supply chain dynamics.

In DPP contexts, selective prediction enables tiered operational workflows: high-confidence verifications (coverage: 60%, accuracy: 99%) proceed through automated approval workflows minimizing manual review costs; medium-uncertainty cases (coverage: 30%, accuracy: 95%) trigger additional documentation requests; low-confidence scenarios (coverage: 10%) escalate to human auditors ensuring critical decisions receive appropriate expert oversight. This tiered approach optimizes resource allocation while maintaining regulatory compliance standards.

### Interpretable Glass-Box Models and Uncertainty Decomposition

Explainable Boosting Machines (EBM), Neural Additive Models (NAM), and Monotonic Generalized Additive Models with Missing Values (M-GAM) provide inherently interpretable predictions ("glass-box models" opposed to "black-box models") through additive decompositions, where overall predictions emerge as sums of feature-specific contributions ([Nori et al., 2019](https://interpret.ml/); [Agarwal et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13912); [Donnelly et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02646)). This transparency proves essential for regulatory compliance, enabling auditors to understand and challenge prediction reasoning—capabilities largely absent from black-box deep learning approaches. M-GAM demonstrates particular relevance for fashion DPP systems due to its principled handling of missing values—a pervasive challenge in supply chain data where typical transactions provide only 20-30% of defined fields, reflecting data collection limitations across multi-tier networks with heterogeneous technological capabilities ([Donnelly et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02646)). M-GAM addresses missingness through specialized model structures rather than imputation, reducing bias from missing-not-at-random patterns ([Little 2021](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-statistics-040720-031104), [Zhang et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1108/IMDS-08-2022-0468), [Zargar et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.13305)) endemic to supply chain contexts where data absence itself carries information about supplier practices and verification capabilities.

Uncertainty Decomposition and Its Limitations: Traditional approaches attempt to decompose total predictive uncertainty into aleatoric (data) uncertainty—arising from inherent randomness in the data-generating process—and epistemic (model) uncertainty—resulting from missing information in the model's training data ([Kendall & Gal, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04977), [Hamidieh et al. 2025](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9Jq7wNrpUI)). For LLMs specifically ([Beigi et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.20199)), decomposition methods include Input Clarification Ensembling ([Kuhn et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08718)) which generates multiple clarifications for ambiguous inputs to isolate aleatoric uncertainty arising from input ambiguity, and mutual information-based approaches quantifying both uncertainties from Bayesian perspectives ([Ling et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10189)).

However, recent theoretical work challenges the conceptual coherence of aleatoric-epistemic dichotomy, revealing that these categories are neither clearly distinct nor orthogonal ([Osband et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20892); [Walha et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22272)). The popular decomposition framework attaches multiple quantities to the same concepts, conflating ideas that ought to be recognized as distinct, and proving insufficiently expressive to capture all uncertainty sources relevant to LLM deployment ([Osband et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20892)). Furthermore, LLMs fundamentally struggle to accurately communicate their internal uncertainty: recent work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art reasoning models cannot reliably explicate their internal answer distributions through self-verbalization, though sampling-based summarization approaches show promise ([Kirchhof et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20295)). These findings suggest that uncertainty decomposition for supply chain LLM agents should be approached pragmatically, focusing on application-specific uncertainty categories (e.g., model bias, robustness, structural uncertainty) rather than strict aleatoric-epistemic separation ([Mucsányi et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19460)).

Critical research gaps persist. Comparative evaluations across diverse DPP use cases remain scarce, limiting evidence-based method selection for specific verification tasks. Hybrid approaches combining CP's formal guarantees with glass-box interpretability warrant investigation, potentially satisfying both statistical rigor and regulatory transparency requirements simultaneously. Calibration strategies for non-stationary supply chains—where verification distributions shift as supplier networks evolve—require principled approaches beyond standard recalibration protocols ([Liu et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15850), [Moore et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08204)). Perhaps most fundamentally, the field lacks consensus on how to properly define, decompose, and measure uncertainty in LLM-based agentic systems, with ongoing research revealing that traditional uncertainty frameworks may be conceptually inadequate for these novel architectures ([Beigi et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20199), [Xia et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00172), [Phillips et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13813), [Devic et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10409),  [Tao et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24202)).

## **Agent Cards: Standardization for Tool Documentation**

Multi-agent DPP systems require standardized mechanisms for capability discovery, enabling agents to identify compatible collaborators and coordinate verification workflows spanning organizational boundaries. Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol addresses this through Agent Cards—structured JSON metadata documents serving as "digital business cards" for AI agents, advertising capabilities, authentication requirements, and communication endpoints ([Google, 2025](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/)). Introduced with support from over 50 technology partners including Atlassian, Salesforce, and SAP, Agent Cards represent an emerging industry standard complementing Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP): while MCP connects agents with tools and data, A2A enables agent-to-agent collaboration in unstructured modalities without requiring shared memory or context. Agent Cards specify agent identity and versioning, capability declarations enumerating supported skills, input/output schemas, OAuth 2.0 authentication requirements, endpoint URLs and protocols (HTTPS, JSON-RPC, Server-Sent Events), and modality support (text, audio, video). For DPP deployments, cards require supply chain-specific extensions: data integrity guarantees documenting verification methods (cryptographic checksums, blockchain anchoring); access control specifications (RBAC, ABAC) for managing sensitive information across trust boundaries; audit trail requirements specifying logging granularity for forensic investigation; transformation transparency describing data modification procedures enabling bias assessment; regulatory alignment metadata mapping capabilities to ESPR mandates; and uncertainty quantification metadata providing calibration data enabling reliability reasoning when composing verification workflows ([Beigi et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20199)).

Agent Cards join an expanding ecosystem of AI documentation artifacts addressing distinct transparency requirements. Model Cards document model architecture, training data, and limitations essential for assessing LLM biases relevant to supply chain contexts ([Mitchell et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1145/3287560.3287596); [Liang et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-024-00857-z)). Data Cards specify dataset provenance and demographics critical for evaluating training data diversity across Global South manufacturers and small-scale suppliers ([Pushkarna et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533231); [Gebru et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010)). Additional specialized cards include System Cards describing end-to-end architectures ([OpenAI, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774)), Use Case Cards providing risk assessments ([Luccioni et al., 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09757-7)), and Feedback Cards capturing stakeholder corrections ([Zhou et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15475)). The EU AI Act increasingly mandates such documentation through Article 13 transparency obligations requiring technical documentation, quality management systems, and risk assessments, making Model Cards and Data Cards de facto requirements for responsible AI deployment in regulated industries ([Marino et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14758), [Hupont et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-024-09757-7), [Cousineau et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s43681-025-00725-5)).

A critical question confronts this ecosystem: Should standardization extend to MCP Server Cards documenting tool-level characteristics analogous to agent-level Agent Cards? While governance needs appear compelling—tools require reliability metrics, compliance metadata, and access control specifications—fundamental concerns arise. First, if Agent Card specifications prove sufficiently expressive to encompass tool-level metadata through field extensions, separate specifications risk ecosystem fragmentation requiring developers to maintain parallel overlapping standards. Second, MCP's mature ecosystem preceded A2A with extensive deployment yet produced no organic Server Card specification despite obvious documentation gaps, suggesting either existing mechanisms (OpenAPI specs, README files, etc.) prove adequate or tool diversity resists standardization. Third, tools provide narrow stateless functions (database queries, API calls) fundamentally distinct from agents' open-ended stateful task completion, potentially warranting specialized documentation—but this distinction remains unproven.

If tool-layer documentation proves necessary, priority should investigate whether Agent Card extensions suffice before introducing dedicated Server Cards. For enterprise adopters in regulated industries, this specification relationship represents pressing concern—architectural decisions with multi-year consequences require stable standards and clear interoperability guarantees rather than proliferating overlapping documentation frameworks. The proliferation of card types reflects recognition that no single artifact captures AI system complexity, yet risks documentation fatigue where maintaining numerous specifications imposes excessive overhead relative to governance benefits ([Liu et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06258)). Future efforts should prioritize consolidation over proliferation, identifying minimal sufficient frameworks rather than maximalist coverage of every conceivable component.

# Security Landscape for MCP-Based DPP Systems

The production challenges identified in Section 4 revealed security immaturity as the most critical barrier to MCP adoption in regulated contexts. This section provides comprehensive threat analysis, examining empirical evidence from real-world deployments and evaluating defense mechanisms necessary for protecting commercially sensitive supply chain data while enabling regulatory transparency.

## Comprehensive Threat Analysis

The enterprise readiness of MCP-based systems faces critical security challenges, highlighted by the January 2025 disclosure of vulnerabilities in Figma's MCP server enabling arbitrary file access and potential system compromise ([DarkReading, 2025](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/figma-mcp-server-agentic-ai-compromise)). This incident, affecting a major enterprise software platform, underscores the gap between MCP's conceptual promise and production-grade security requirements for regulated industries.

Systematic analysis of 2,562 real-world MCP applications across 23 functional categories produces the first comprehensive taxonomy of attack vectors ([Zhao et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2025.mcp.taxonomy); [Guo et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12538)). By functional category, Developer Tools account for the highest total API calls to dangerous interfaces (626), followed by API Development (511) and Data Science & ML (196). Categories with high API usage pose elevated risk due to broader resource access, making them priority targets for security assessment.

## Defense-in-Depth Protocol Stack

Defense-in-depth requires sophisticated, multi-layered approaches extending beyond any single protocol. Various defense-in-depth architectures have been proposed, integrating MCP with complementary protocols for identity, authorization, and communication.

**Table 6: Complementary Protocol Comparison for MCP Security**

| Protocol | Purpose | Maturity | Adoption | Security Features | Integration with MCP | Limitations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

**Protocol Stack Architecture:** Current production deployments primarily leverage MCP for tool access combined with A2A for agent communication ([Google, 2024](https://developers.google.com/agent-to-agent); [Anthropic, 2024](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture)). Emerging protocols like XAA propose enhanced authorization frameworks ([Okta, 2025](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2025/09/03/cross-app-access)) and ANS provides identity infrastructure, though adoption remains experimental. This review focuses on MCP and A2A as the most mature protocol layers for DPP systems.

## Runtime Defense Mechanisms: Comparative Analysis

Recent research proposes multiple runtime defense systems for MCP-based environments. This section compares approaches, analyzing threat coverage, performance characteristics, and deployment complexity.

| **OpenTelemetry \+ OPA** | Traditional monitoring \+ policy | 93.98% detection | Higher than specialized | Generic policy violations, access control | Moderate: Established tools | [Wang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858) (baseline comparison) |

**MCP-Guard Architecture:** Employs three-stage detection pipeline with quantified performance at each stage ([Xing et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10991)):

* **Stage 1 (Lightweight Static Scanning):** 97.67% precision, 0.87ms average latency across seven specialized detectors (SQL Injection, Sensitive File, Shadow Hijack, Prompt Injection, Important Tag, Shell Injection, Cross-Origin)
* **Stage 2 (Deep Neural Detection):** 96.01% accuracy via E5-based embeddings, 55.06ms latency, trained on 70,448 adversarial samples
* **Stage 3 (Intelligent Arbitration):** 89.63% accuracy, 89.07% F1-score through LLM-powered synthesis (using Mistral:7B configuration)

Comparative evaluation demonstrates superior performance: 99.54% recall versus 85.65% for MCP-Scan and 93.50% for MCP-Shield, while reducing detection latency by approximately **5× on average** (456ms average for full pipeline versus 2,293ms for SafeMCP). The fastest configuration (Llama3:8B at 91.47ms) achieves up to **25× speedup** over SafeMCP ([Xing et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10991)).

**MI9 Runtime Governance:** Provides integrated runtime governance with measured effectiveness across 1,033 synthetic agent scenarios, achieving 99.81% detection rate—outperforming OpenTelemetry \+ OPA by **5.83%** and LangSmith \+ OPA by 31.29% ([Wang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858)). Key components include:

* **Agency-Risk Index (ARI):** Calibrates oversight intensity based on quantified agent autonomy, adaptability, and continuity
* **Agentic Telemetry Schema:** Captures governance-semantic events (cognitive, action, and coordination behaviors) invisible to conventional monitoring
* **Graduated Containment:** Enables nuanced interventions (monitoring augmentation → planning restriction → tool restriction → execution isolation) preserving operational continuity

MI9's advantage stems from agent-semantic telemetry that captures cognitive events (goal revision, memory retrieval, planning decisions) systematically missed by infrastructure-focused frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates MI9's superiority across actionable intelligence metrics: causal chain clarity (0.822 vs. 0.448 for OpenTelemetry), predictive alerting (0.672 vs. 0.341), and proactive intervention capability (0.578 vs. 0.116) ([Wang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858)).

**Complementarity Analysis:** These systems target different threat vectors and deployment contexts:

* **MCP-Guard** excels at detecting malicious tool inputs/outputs through layered analysis (injection attacks)
* **MI9** focuses on runtime behavioral governance and privilege escalation through agent-semantic monitoring (policy violations)
* **ETDI** addresses trust issues in tool discovery and registration (supply chain security)
* **CaMeL** provides OS-level isolation and containment (system-level protection)

Defense-in-depth strategies combining multiple mechanisms achieve superior security posture. For example, MCP-Guard's detection pipeline could feed violation signals into MI9's containment framework, while CaMeL provides underlying sandboxing for high-risk agent operations. However, integration complexity and cumulative performance overhead require careful evaluation for production deployment.

# Physical-Digital Integration for Trust Engineering

Sections 4 and 5 established that MCP-based systems face significant challenges in memory management, uncertainty quantification, and security—all addressable through technical innovation. Yet these digital solutions encounter an irreducible limitation: no amount of cryptographic sophistication can verify physical reality without physical verification. This section examines technologies and economic models bridging the digital-physical gap essential for trustworthy DPP systems.

## The Oracle Problem in Supply Chain Verification

Digital systems face an inherent limitation in verifying physical-world claims—while cryptographic signatures ensure data integrity during transmission and storage, they cannot confirm that initial data entry corresponds to physical reality ([Caldarelli & Higgins, 2020](https://doi.org/10.3390/info11110509); [Pasdar et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12062391)). A supplier's digitally signed claim of "organic cotton from Uzbekistan" is cryptographically authentic as their statement, yet provides no assurance about actual cotton origin or organic status ([Egbertsen et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2023.103672)). Blockchain immutability applies solely to recorded data, not to input accuracy ([Caldarelli, 2020](https://doi.org/10.3390/info11110509)).

This distinction between digital authenticity (cryptographic verification of data provenance) and physical authenticity (correspondence with real-world objects) necessitates physical verification mechanisms as ground truth anchors for DPP systems. Without physical verification, supply chain data represents claims requiring trust rather than verified facts enabling confidence ([Pasdar et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12062391)).

### **Bayesian Knowledge Graphs for Physical Grounding**

Physical verification can be modeled as Bayesian updates in probabilistic knowledge graphs ([Nafar et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.15918v1); [Toroghi & Sanner, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v38i18.30040)). Prior beliefs about supplier claims "derived from historical data, certifications, third-party audits "are updated with high-confidence physical verification results (e.g., isotope ratio analysis confirming Vietnam origin). These updates propagate through the supply chain graph, refining beliefs about all connected entities.

For example, if a spot-check confirms Supplier A's organic cotton claim through forensic testing, confidence in related claims increases: Supplier A's other shipments (same production system), downstream processors using Supplier A's materials (inherited authenticity), and comparable suppliers in the same region (geographic clustering). The magnitude of confidence updates depends on graph topology and prior reliability; data-highly connected suppliers provide stronger evidence than isolated nodes ([Seedat et al. 2025](https://openreview.net/forum?id=2GEipEDZB0)).

Risk-based verification strategies use the knowledge graph to identify critical uncertainty points, deploying sparse but high-impact physical tests. Rather than attempting to verify every claim (economically infeasible), the system identifies:

* High-uncertainty nodes (conflicting evidence, new suppliers)
* High-impact nodes (large material volumes, critical certifications)
* Strategic sampling points (chokepoints where single verification informs many downstream claims)

Real-time IoT sensor data provides continuous updates complementing periodic physical testing. Temperature sensors in shipping containers, RFID location tracking, and blockchain-anchored timestamps create audit trails constraining possible manipulation. However, sensor data reliability itself requires verification-compromised sensors or manipulated data streams undermine IoT-based trust.

## **Authentication Technology Landscape**

Physical verification requires technologies producing evidence resistant to manipulation. This section surveys authentication approaches applicable to fashion supply chains, analyzing trade-offs between accuracy, cost, durability, and deployment complexity.

**Table 8: Physical Authentication Technology Comparison**

## **Economic Models for Physical Verification**

A critical barrier to physical verification adoption in DPP systems lies in the misalignment of incentives across supply chain participants: the question of who bears verification costs when multiple stakeholders derive benefits from authenticated data remains unresolved in both theoretical and practical terms. This section systematically reviews emerging economic models addressing cost allocation challenges, examining their theoretical foundations, empirical evidence, and applicability across different market contexts.

**Brand-Funded Verification Models** position manufacturers or retailers as primary investors in authentication infrastructure, motivated by brand equity protection and counterfeit risk mitigation. The economic logic centers on return-on-investment calculations incorporating both risk avoidance—including reputation damage and regulatory non-compliance penalties—and revenue enhancement through consumer trust premiums. This model exhibits natural applicability to luxury goods segments where product margins can absorb per-unit verification expenditures. However, precise quantification of verification costs and sustainable price points remains poorly documented in peer-reviewed literature. While industry practice suggests verification costs in ranges of $10-50 per unit for comprehensive authentication on premium products exceeding $500 retail value ([OECD 2019](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/trends-in-trade-in-counterfeit-and-pirated-goods_g2g9f533-en.html)), these figures lack rigorous academic validation. For mass-market products with lower margins, economic viability proves more questionable, requiring empirical investigation of cost reduction opportunities through technological advances, process optimization, and volume economies.

**Insurance-Linked Verification Models** propose that supply chains demonstrating verified product authenticity and process compliance should qualify for reduced insurance premiums, with premium reductions offsetting verification infrastructure costs. The theoretical foundation rests on risk transfer economics: insurers bearing exposure to counterfeit-related losses, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory penalties should rationally price policies based on observable risk factors including verification rigor. Implementation requires two critical prerequisites currently lacking mature frameworks: standardization of verification protocols enabling consistent risk assessment across insurers and industries, and empirical data linking verification intensity to claim frequency and severity. One potentially relevant parallel appears in supply chain insurance contexts where recent research examines how improved transparency and risk management practices affect insurance availability and pricing ([Ghadge et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1108/SCM-10-2018-0357)), though direct application to DPP verification contexts requires validation. The extent to which verification demonstrably reduces insurable losses—and the magnitude of resulting premium reductions—constitute critical empirical questions requiring controlled studies comparing loss experiences across verified versus unverified supply chains.

**Validation-as-a-Service (VaaS) Models** introduce specialized third-party providers offering verification services on subscription or per-sample bases, reducing upfront capital requirements for individual brands while achieving economies of scale through shared infrastructure. Empirical examples include [Entrupy](https://www.entrupy.com/) offering luxury product authentication services, [Haelixa](https://haelixa.com/) providing DNA-based fiber traceability testing, and [Oritain](https://oritain.com//) employing forensic science methodologies for origin verification. These organizations demonstrate commercial viability at current market scales, though publicly available information regarding their operational economics remains limited. Whether VaaS can scale to serve mass-market fashion segments—where per-unit economics prove more constrained and testing volumes potentially exceed current provider capacities by orders of magnitude—requires investigation. Critical questions include competitive dynamics and market structure evolution: as verification demand grows with regulatory pressure, will VaaS markets sustain sufficient providers to ensure competitive pricing, or will network effects drive consolidation toward oligopolistic structures? How should accreditation and quality assurance operate for VaaS providers given their role as trust intermediaries? What liability frameworks appropriately allocate responsibility when verification errors occur?

**Consumer-Driven Premium Pricing Models** hypothesize that end consumers will accept price premiums for products with verified sustainability and authenticity claims, enabling verification costs to pass through supply chains to final purchasers ([Schiaroli et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jik.2025.100764)). However, empirical evidence regarding consumer willingness-to-pay exhibits considerable heterogeneity across studies, product categories, and market contexts ([Tully and Winer 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretai.2014.03.004), [Toth-Peter et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.4269)). While various research streams demonstrate consumer preferences for sustainable products in stated preference surveys ([Khan et al. ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.141024), ([Hunka et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2025.03.020)), translating such preferences into actual purchasing behavior at premium price points proves more challenging. The frequently cited range of 5-15% price premiums for verified sustainability claims lacks definitive academic substantiation through rigorous revealed preference studies or controlled market experiments. Gamification strategies for product narratives represent attempts to enhance consumer engagement with verification systems, potentially increasing willingness-to-pay through experiential value beyond mere certification ([Arnesson and Westman, 2022](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn%3Anbn%3Ase%3Aumu%3Adiva-197002), [Alves et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.3390/su15065398), [Bouchillon 2025](https://www.proquest.com/openview/3de02f26fd7ba740b9ec9a5bc194603f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y)), though empirical evaluation remains nascent. Consumer education requirements pose additional challenges ([Morris et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-22018-1_14), [Mellick et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1108/JFMM-07-2024-0275))—for consumer-driven models to function effectively, consumers must understand what verification signifies, trust verification sources, and perceive value commensurate with price premiums.

**Comparative Analysis**: Table 9 synthesizes key characteristics of the four economic models, highlighting their distinct cost-bearing structures, value capture mechanisms, scalability properties, suitable application contexts, and implementation challenges. No single model dominates across all contexts. Optimal approaches likely involve hybrid structures combining elements from multiple models—for instance, brand-funded baseline verification supplemented by consumer premiums for enhanced transparency, or VaaS infrastructure supported by insurance incentives reducing systemic risk. However, design of such hybrid models requires understanding interaction effects and potential unintended consequences that current literature does not adequately address. Critical research gaps requiring empirical investigation include: systematic studies of consumer willingness-to-pay for verified DPP claims across diverse product categories, demographic segments, and sustainability attributes; optimal cost allocation models formally balancing incentive alignment, economic viability, and equitable distribution of benefits across supply chain tiers; actuarial analyses quantifying insurance premium reductions achievable through specified verification protocols; and longitudinal studies of VaaS provider business models examining sustainability, competitive dynamics, and market structure evolution as verification demand scales with regulatory implementation.

**Table 9: Economic Model Comparison for DPP Verification**

| Model | Cost Bearer | Value Capture | Scalability | Suitable Contexts | Challenges | Empirical Evidence |
  |:------|:------------|:--------------|:------------|:------------------|:-----------|:-------------------|
  | **Brand-Funded** | Brand | Brand equity protection, risk mitigation | Limited (high per-unit cost) | Luxury goods, high-margin products
   | ROI uncertain for mass-market items | Limited (industry estimates $10-50/unit lack academic validation) |
  | **Insurance-Linked** | Distributed (via premium reduction) | Risk transfer to insurers | High (actuarial scaling) | Supply chains with
  significant insurable risks | Requires standardized verification protocols and actuarial frameworks | Very limited (no actuarial studies
  linking verification to premium reductions) |
  | **Validation-as-a-Service** | Shared (subscription/per-test) | Service provider revenue | High (economies of scale) | SMEs, multi-brand
   platforms | Provider viability depends on demand aggregation and market structure | Moderate (Entrupy, Haelixa, Oritain demonstrate
  viability at current scales) |
  | **Consumer-Driven** | Consumer | Enhanced product value | Medium (constrained by price sensitivity) | Differentiated products,
  sustainability-conscious segments | Requires consumer education and trust establishment | Weak (5-15% premium claims lack rigorous
  revealed preference validation) |


## **Digital Twin Architectures for Supply Chain Transparency**

Physical verification mechanisms provide ground truth data enabling construction of digital twins—real-time virtual representations of physical products maintained through continuous synchronization of sensor data, verification checkpoints, and predictive models ([Grieves and Vickers, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-38756-7_4)). Recent research demonstrates that digital twin architectures offer substantial potential for enhanced supply chain visibility, predictive analytics capabilities, and scenario-based planning in complex networks ([Kim et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/machines13020109); [Roman et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/logistics9010022); [Badakhshan & Ivanov, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2025.2507112)).

### **Digital Twin Architecture and Data Integration**

Digital twin systems in supply chain contexts integrate multiple heterogeneous data streams to maintain current state estimates and support decision-making ([Zaidi et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sca.2024.100075), [Le and Fan 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2023.109768), [Wasi et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03692), [Zia et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hcc.2025.100303)). The architecture encompasses four primary data sources contributing distinct forms of evidence. Physical verification results provide periodic high-confidence updates through laboratory testing, authentication procedures, or on-site inspections, establishing ground truth against which other data sources can be calibrated. Internet-of-Things sensor data enables continuous environmental monitoring including temperature, humidity, location tracking, and handling events throughout product journeys ([Cil et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41072-022-00110-z), [Rehman et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1111/exsy.13467)). Transaction records document ownership transfers, processing operations, and supply chain handoffs through enterprise resource planning (ERP) )systems ([Hrischev and Shakev, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1109/IS61756.2024.10705183), [Anjaria 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-96-7734-4)). Predictive models employ machine learning techniques to forecast product degradation, authenticate suspicious products through anomaly detection, and anticipate supply chain disruptions ([Skenderi et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06972), [Qi et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03811)).

The digital twin maintains probabilistic state estimates updated through Bayesian inference frameworks as new evidence arrives from these diverse sources ([Nafar et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.15918v1)). This probabilistic representation explicitly quantifies uncertainty in product state, enabling risk-based decision protocols where high-certainty states support automated processing while high-uncertainty states trigger additional verification or human oversight. The Bayesian framework provides principled mechanisms for fusing evidence of varying quality and reliability, weighting contributions according to demonstrated accuracy and relevance.

### **Digital Twin Applications in DPP Systems**

Digital twin architectures enable several functional capabilities relevant to DPP objectives and circular economy transitions ([Polimetla et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.70038)). Predictive maintenance applications leverage product degradation models to forecast optimal repair or replacement timing, extending product lifecycles through proactive intervention rather than reactive replacement upon failure. By anticipating maintenance needs before critical failures occur, digital twins support circular economy models emphasizing product longevity and resource conservation ([Wahab et al.. 2024](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.1943)).

Counterfeit detection exploits digital twin predictions of expected product behavior—including typical usage patterns, environmental exposures, and supply chain trajectories—to identify anomalies requiring investigation ([Erceylan et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10207-025-01043-x)). Significant deviations between observed product data and twin-predicted behavior signal potential counterfeits, unauthorized substitutions, or quality failures meriting scrutiny. This approach complements physical verification by prioritizing suspicious products for testing rather than requiring universal verification of all items.

Supply chain optimization applications employ digital twins for scenario analysis supporting route planning, inventory management, and disruption response strategies ([Freese and Ludwig, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/13675567.2024.2324895)). By maintaining virtual representations of current network state, decision-makers can evaluate what-if scenarios exploring alternative routing options, inventory positioning strategies, or supplier selection criteria before implementing changes in physical operations ([Kim et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/machines13020109)). This capability proves particularly valuable during disruptions when rapid decision-making under uncertainty becomes critical.

Regulatory reporting automation represents another application domain where digital twins can reduce administrative burden, building on established practices from other regulated industries ([Zacharia, 2025](https://oneclicklca.com/en/resources/articles/ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation-guide)). Financial services have deployed RegTech platforms achieving near-real-time regulatory reporting ([Arner et al. 2016](https://ssrn.com/abstract=2847806), [Charoenwong et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2024.103792), [Eulerich et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.2308/HORIZONS-2023-060), [Sekwenz et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1145/3707640.3731929)), while pharmaceutical manufacturing employs continuous process verification under FDA's Quality by Design initiative ([Yu et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-007-9511-1)). Similar to medical MLOps systems that capture every interaction during device development for FDA compliance ([Granlund et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08006v1), [Cardoso et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14570)), digital twins in fashion supply chains maintain comprehensive product history and current compliance status in structured digital representations. These twins enable automated extraction of metrics required for ESPR reporting including carbon footprints, recycled content percentages, and end-of-life handling ([Lüttin 2024](https://www.carbonfact.com/blog/policy/espr-textile)), following the paradigm of 'continuous compliance' rather than periodic reporting cycles. This approach mirrors post-market surveillance systems being developed for medical AI algorithms, where distribution shift detection and performance monitoring occur continuously rather than through manual audits ([Koch et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-024-01085-w)), reducing manual data compilation efforts while improving reporting accuracy and timeliness.

### **Technical and Organizational Challenges**

Despite demonstrated benefits, digital twin implementations confront substantial technical and organizational challenges that constrain near-term adoption at scales required for comprehensive DPP systems. Computational costs of maintaining twins for millions or billions of products represent a significant barrier. While precise cost figures require empirical benchmarking studies not yet available in published literature, the infrastructure investments necessary for real-time twin maintenance at billion-product scales likely prove prohibitive without substantial cost reduction through algorithmic efficiency gains or infrastructure innovations.

Data synchronization latency between physical state changes and digital twin updates can undermine decision-making quality in fast-moving supply chains where conditions change rapidly ([Shen et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-85457-6)). When twins lag physical reality by minutes to hours, decisions based on twin state may prove suboptimal or counterproductive. Achieving near-real-time synchronization requires high-frequency data collection, low-latency communication networks, and efficient update algorithms—each contributing to system cost and complexity ([Zhang et al. 2024]()https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2024.102773).

Privacy concerns arise from detailed product tracking capabilities that may reveal sensitive consumer behavior patterns including purchase histories, usage intensities, and disposal practices ([Bäumer et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-024-03413-z))). Regulatory frameworks including GDPR impose constraints on personal data collection and processing that digital twin systems must respect through careful data governance designs ([Li and Wang, 2025](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.2877), [Brauneck et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.2196/41588), [Truong et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2021.102402), [Gaurav et al. 2025](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18765)). Balancing transparency objectives supporting circular economy goals against privacy protection requirements presents non-trivial challenges requiring both technical safeguards (anonymization, differential privacy) and organizational policies (data minimization, purpose limitation).

Standardization gaps impede interoperability across heterogeneous products and organizational boundaries. The absence of standardized digital twin representations—including data schemas, interface specifications, and semantic models—hinders creation of interoperable twin ecosystems where twins from different manufacturers or supply chain tiers can communicate effectively ([David et al. 2024](https://www.nist.gov/publications/interoperability-digital-twins-challenges-success-factors-and-future-research), [Shao 2021](https://www.nist.gov/publications/use-case-scenarios-digital-twin-implementation-based-iso-23247)). Industry efforts toward standardization through consortia and standards bodies remain nascent, with multiple competing approaches lacking clear convergence pathways ([Roman et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/logistics9010022)).

## **Scalability Considerations and Architectural Trade-offs**

Digital twin architectures for DPP systems must balance representational fidelity—the level of detail maintained about each product—against computational feasibility at billion-product scales. Maintaining high-fidelity twins with granular state variables, frequent updates, and sophisticated predictive models for every mass-market garment proves computationally prohibitive under current technological and economic constraints ([Tao et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-024-00603-w)).

Hierarchical twin architectures may provide a viable compromise, maintaining aggregate twins at product category or batch level with detailed twins reserved for high-value items or products flagged as suspicious through anomaly detection. Such architectures reduce average computational requirements while preserving detailed tracking for cases where it provides greatest value ([Wang et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119299)). However, this architectural pattern—while computationally motivated—lacks empirical validation in DPP contexts. The optimal granularity level, criteria for triggering detailed twin instantiation, and performance trade-offs across different hierarchy designs constitute open research questions requiring investigation through prototype implementations and controlled experiments.

Alternative scalability approaches include adaptive fidelity mechanisms ([Li et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMC60390.2024.00014)) that dynamically adjust twin detail levels based on current needs—increasing resolution when products enter critical supply chain phases or trigger anomaly alerts, and reducing resolution during routine operations. Edge computing architectures distributing twin computation to supply chain nodes rather than centralizing in cloud infrastructure might reduce latency and bandwidth requirements while raising challenges in ensuring consistency across distributed twin instances ([Li et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10845-024-02424-0), [Zhang et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18725)).

# **Future Directions and Research Agenda**

The preceding sections have examined DPP implementation across multiple dimensions—architecture (Section 3), production challenges (Section 4), security (Section 5), and physical verification (Section 6)—revealing significant gaps between current capabilities and requirements for production-ready systems. This section synthesizes these findings into a structured research agenda, organized by temporal horizon and identifying critical research questions requiring investigation before agent-based DPP systems can achieve widespread industrial adoption.

## **Open Research Questions**

### **Empirical Validation Deficits**

Real-world pilot deployments with rigorous evaluation protocols remain scarce relative to the scope of claimed capabilities. CIRPASS-2 pilots involving H&M, Zalando, and Inditex provide valuable initial validation ([Fashion United, 2024](https://fashionunited.com/news/business/h-m-zalando-join-eu-digital-product-passport-pilot)), yet published performance metrics addressing scalability limits, operational costs, security posture under realistic threat models, and failure mode characterization have not entered the academic literature. Priority research areas include: empirical studies measuring system performance (latency, throughput, accuracy) in production environments; operational cost analysis spanning infrastructure, maintenance, and verification expenses across deployment scales; security resilience testing under realistic attack scenarios beyond proof-of-concept exploits; and user acceptance studies for conversational DPP interfaces across stakeholder groups including consumers, supply chain partners, and regulatory authorities.

### **Formal Verification and Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Agent Systems**

The integration of formal methods with large language model-based multi-agent systems represents a critical frontier for production-ready DPP implementations, where regulatory compliance mandates verifiable guarantees rather than probabilistic assurances ([Koohestani, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23864); [Ramani et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03469)). Recent advances in neurosymbolic approaches demonstrate that hybrid architectures combining neural flexibility with symbolic rigor can achieve both adaptability and correctness-by-construction ([Miculicich et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05156))—a particularly salient requirement for fashion supply chains where data heterogeneity spans structured ERP systems, unstructured supplier documents, and physically grounded verification results requiring coherent integration under formal consistency guarantees. Runtime verification frameworks such as AgentGuard ([Koohestani, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23864)) employ probabilistic model checking over Markov Decision Process abstractions derived from agent execution traces, enabling dynamic quantitative assurances answering queries including "what is the probability that data harmonization completes successfully within 30 seconds given current supplier document quality?" Such temporal guarantees, expressible in Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL), transform opaque agent behaviors into mathematically verifiable properties amenable to regulatory audit. The parallel development of plan verification tools bridging LLM-generated action sequences with bounded model checking ([Ramani et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03469)) reveals persistent challenges in semantic fidelity, yet semantic correspondence between intended meaning and generated models requires deeper investigation, suggesting that fully automated formal verification of complex supply chain orchestration patterns remains aspirational rather than immediately deployable.

Uncertainty quantification in multi-agent DPP systems necessitates frameworks extending beyond traditional aleatoric-epistemic decompositions ([Beigi et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.20199)), which recent empirical studies demonstrate fail to achieve practical disentanglement ([](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19460))—proposed estimator pairs exhibit high internal correlation (rank correlation ≥0.78) and fail to unmix uncertainty components as theoretically intended. Contemporary taxonomies distinguish operational uncertainty, arising during model training and inference processes, from output uncertainty, concerning the reliability and evidential support of generated content ([Beigi et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.20199))—a distinction particularly relevant for fashion DPP applications where operational uncertainties emerge from heterogeneous data sources (Tier 1 digital invoices versus Tier 3 handwritten certificates) while output uncertainties manifest in the credibility of harmonized sustainability claims requiring justification for regulatory compliance. Methodologies such as Heterogeneous Data Quality Modeling (HDQM) provide formal frameworks for reasoning about uncertainty across structured and unstructured data modalities, enabling sound probabilistic bounds even when exact verification suffers combinatorial explosion ([arXiv:2510.05156](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05156)). The application of Probabilistic Epistemic Logic (PCTLK) to multi-agent systems with incomplete knowledge ([arXiv:2510.05156](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05156)) offers formal semantics for distributed reasoning scenarios endemic to supply chains, where individual agents possess partial information about supplier networks yet must collectively establish confidence in end-to-end traceability claims—formal verification demonstrates that certain epistemic properties (e.g., "at least one agent knows the Tier 0 forest source with >90% confidence") hold under specified communication protocols and data sharing constraints.

Smart contract verification methodologies developed for blockchain-based supply chain traceability demonstrate that LLM-assisted formal methods can detect adversarial manipulation patterns invisible to traditional static analysis ([Liu et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18934); [Sun et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24698)). The FinDet system ([Liu et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18934)) translates contract bytecode into semantic natural language descriptions, applies fund-flow reachability analysis across three-phase lifecycles (analogous to material provenance → manufacturing transformation → retail distribution in fashion contexts), and employs multi-perspective semantic reasoning with explicit uncertainty quantification achieving 0.9223 balanced accuracy with 30 adversarial contracts detected in 10-day production deployment. LISA's agentic framework ([Sun et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24698)) identified $7.2M in preventable losses across ten decentralized finance (DeFi) incidents through logic vulnerability detection missed by conventional auditing tools, suggesting that multi-agent architectures with specialized domain knowledge can outperform monolithic analysis approaches—a finding with direct implications for DPP systems requiring coordinated verification across material composition, chemical compliance, labor conditions, and carbon footprint dimensions simultaneously. PropertyGPT's demonstration that GPT-4 can generate formal invariants for Ethereum smart contracts with 80% recall ([Liu et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02580)), detecting twelve zero-day vulnerabilities, indicates potential for automated property generation from natural language regulatory text (e.g., ESPR Article 7 information requirements) translatable into verifiable temporal logic specifications—though current tools achieve promise primarily in narrowly scoped domains rather than complex multi-stakeholder supply chain scenarios.

The paradigm of correct-by-construction synthesis, where verification properties co-evolve with generated artifacts through iterative refinement ([Miculicich et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05156)), presents compelling advantages over post-hoc verification approaches for DPP data harmonization workflows. VeriGuard's framework generates both LLM-produced code and accompanying verification policies, iteratively refining until formal properties hold—analogously, DPP systems could generate supplier data extraction routines alongside provenance proofs, material composition constraints, and regulatory compliance certificates as first-class artifacts rather than afterthoughts. Correct-by-construction approaches mitigate the semantic drift problem observed in plan verification ([Ramani et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03469)), where syntactically valid formal models semantically diverge from intended behaviors, by maintaining tight coupling between natural language specifications, generated implementations, and formal guarantees throughout development rather than attempting post-facto correspondence proofs. The integration of formal methods with geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) standards in generative CAD ([Zhou et al. 2025](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08603)) offers instructive parallels for fashion technical specifications—size charts, material composition tolerances, and dyeing colorfastness requirements could be formalized as constraints analogous to ASME Y14.5 geometric specifications, enabling model-based definition where single sources of truth carry machine-verifiable consistency proofs rather than requiring manual cross-referencing across disconnected documents prone to version skew and specification drift.

Critical research gaps persist at the intersection of formal verification and production DPP systems. Scalability of probabilistic model checking to agent populations numbering thousands operating over supply networks spanning tens of thousands of supplier entities remains undemonstrated—current verification tools handle tens to low hundreds of states before encountering state explosion. The relationship between verification granularity and practical utility for regulatory compliance lacks empirical characterization: must every individual data transformation carry formal proofs, or do aggregate statistical guarantees over agent populations suffice for ESPR conformance? The economic trade-offs between formal verification investments and expected liability reduction from false sustainability claims require quantification through actuarial modeling incorporating both compliance costs and penalty risk distributions. Automated property specification from natural language regulatory text, while theoretically promising, currently achieves reliable results only with extensive human oversight—the pathway from 80% automated property generation ([Liu et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02580)) to the 99.9%+ reliability threshold acceptable for autonomous regulatory compliance remains unclear. Finally, the integration of runtime verification with adaptive learning ([Lim et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1109/BIGCOMP.2016.7425981), [Engelmann et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.4204/EPTCS.362.5)), where agents refine behaviors based on deployment experience while maintaining formal safety invariants, represents a fundamental research challenge balancing continuous improvement against verified correctness preservation—how systems learn without invalidating prior proofs constitutes an open question with significant implications for long-lived DPP infrastructure expected to operate across multi-decade product lifecycles.

### **Memory and Context Management**

Memory architecture design for multi-agent systems operating in supply chain contexts presents several optimization problems lacking empirical resolution ([Yuen et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08997), [Raza et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04133)). The relationship between supply chain characteristics—including tier depth, geographic distribution, and data volume—and optimal memory architecture configurations remains poorly understood. Long-term learning strategies enabling agents to adapt to evolving supply chain structures without catastrophic forgetting require development and validation ([Lin et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15103), [Bell et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03320), [Fang et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07407)). Privacy-preserving memory sharing approaches that enable collective intelligence across competing brands, while protecting commercially sensitive information, represent both a technical and governance challenge ([Zheng et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2024.2432469), [Orabi et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-025-01099-5)). The question of when added memory complexity provides sufficient performance improvements to justify increased operational overhead and cost lacks clear decision frameworks. Finally, mechanisms for handling contradictory information from sources with varying reliability levels—a common occurrence in supply chains with limited transparency—require principled approaches grounded in uncertainty quantification ([Cortes-Gomez et al. 2025](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01767), [Seedat et al. 2025](https://openreview.net/forum?id=2GEipEDZB0)).

### **Uncertainty Quantification**

Several fundamental questions in uncertainty quantification for agentic systems remain unresolved. Whether hybrid methods can successfully combine conformal prediction's coverage guarantees ([Kumar et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15610)) with the explanatory power of interpretable models ([McTavish et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02646)) represents a promising research direction requiring empirical validation. Calibration strategies for non-stationary supply chain data exhibiting distribution shift—arising from changing supplier practices, evolving regulations, and market dynamics—need adaptation beyond standard conformal prediction assumptions of exchangeability ([Lin et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05566), [Badkul and Xie, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15233), [Xu et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13297)) The determination of optimal abstention thresholds for regulatory compliance contexts, balancing coverage requirements against accuracy guarantees, involves domain-specific considerations requiring collaboration between AI researchers and legal experts ([Cortes-Gomez et al. 2025](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01767), [Rabanser 2025](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07556)). Integration pathways for uncertainty quantification into agent decision-making workflows, enabling genuinely risk-aware reasoning rather than post-hoc uncertainty estimation ([Huang et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15722), [Duan et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17419), [Stoisser et all. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02401)), remain underexplored. Finally, formal frameworks linking probabilistic uncertainty estimates to specific regulatory compliance requirements ([FDA AI Drug Development Guidance, 2025](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder/artificial-intelligence-drug-development), [Granlund et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2024.3414368)) under instruments such as the ESPR transparency mandates require development to bridge technical and legal domains.

### **Physical-Digital Integration**

The economics and methodology of physical verification in DPP systems present numerous research opportunities. Cost-optimal sampling strategies for physical verification, given budget constraints and complex supply chain topology, require operations research approaches incorporating both verification costs and expected value of information. Bayesian update propagation mechanisms in sparse verification scenarios—where only a small fraction of claims receive physical verification—need principled approaches for quantifying and propagating uncertainty ([Papamarkou et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00809), [Protte et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15439)). Economic models for verification cost allocation that appropriately balance incentive alignment across supply chain tiers, from raw material producers to final retailers, require game-theoretic analysis and empirical validation ([Fan et al. 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sLQb8q0sUi), [Li et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05304)). Consumer trust dynamics in response to partial versus complete verification transparency remain poorly understood, with implications for optimal disclosure strategies ([Montecchi et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1002/mar.22048), [Nguyen and Bguyen, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1108/jcm-07-2024-7005)). Finally, the technical feasibility of digital twins achieving real-time synchronization with physical products at scales approaching billions of items requires both algorithmic advances and infrastructure innovation.

### **Orchestration and Scalability**

Fundamental questions about multi-agent system architecture for supply chain applications await empirical resolution. Comparative studies of centralized versus decentralized orchestration patterns across supply chain scale regimes—from small enterprises with dozens of agents to multinational corporations with thousands—would inform architectural decisions grounded in empirical evidence rather than theoretical conjecture ([Yang et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00587), [Sun et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14743), ). Scaling laws characterizing how system performance degrades or improves as agent populations grow from tens to thousands would enable capacity planning and architectural evolution strategies ([Jin et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09772)). Latency-accuracy trade-offs in real-time supply chain monitoring under bounded computational resources require characterization to inform resource allocation decisions. Graceful degradation strategies under partial failures—including agent unavailability, network partitions, and data source outages—need design patterns validated through fault injection experiments ([Chu et al. 2004](https://doi.org/10.1145/3643915.3644090), [Li et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1145/3686803), [Sapkota et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10468)).

### **Federated Learning and Privacy**

Privacy-preserving collaboration mechanisms across competing supply chain participants present both technical and institutional challenges. How privacy-preserving techniques enable collective intelligence without revealing competitive secrets—including supplier relationships, pricing structures, and volume data—requires cryptographic advances and careful protocol design ([Tang et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2024.112475), [Orabi et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-025-01099-5)). Data valuation methods that fairly attribute value to asymmetric supply chain contributions, where some actors provide more or higher-quality data than others, need both technical frameworks and governance mechanisms ([Chen et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.14778/3659437.3659459), [Al-Saedi et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2024.107639)). Whether federated learning can enable collaborative data harmonization ([Chen et al. 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=G89r8Mgi5r), [Kokash et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20020), [Mateus et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2024.104661)), while preserving data locality—a key requirement for suppliers reluctant to share raw data—requires demonstration through pilot deployments. Finally, applicability limits of swarm learning approaches in supply chain contexts with highly heterogeneous participants, including variations in data quality, computational resources, and governance maturity, require empirical characterization.

### **Comparative Benchmarking Needs**

Systematic comparisons across architectural choices are largely absent from existing literature, complicating evidence-based design decisions. Critical areas requiring controlled empirical investigation include: orchestration patterns (star topologies with centralized orchestrators versus mesh topologies with decentralized peer-to-peer communication versus hierarchical hybrid approaches) evaluated across supply chain scale regimes from small enterprises with dozens of agents to multinational corporations with thousands ([Zhou et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02533); [Moore, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12683)); memory architectures spanning context-window-only designs to complex multi-tier hierarchies assessed across task complexity levels characteristic of different verification workflows ([Wang & Chen, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07957); [Xu et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110)); uncertainty quantification methods including conformal prediction ([Angelopoulos & Bates, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07511)), selective prediction ([Kirichenko et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09038); [Wen et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18418)), and interpretable glass-box models ([McTavish et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02646)) requiring comparative evaluation across regulatory requirements and data characteristics; and defense mechanisms including MCP-Guard ([Xing et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10991)), MI9 ([Wang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858)), ETDI ([Bhatt et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01333)), and CaMeL ([Tallam & Miller, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22852)) tested across threat models representing realistic adversary capabilities and objectives. Controlled experiments systematically varying architectural parameters while measuring performance, cost, and security would inform design decisions grounded in empirical evidence rather than theoretical conjecture or vendor claims.

Establishing rigorous evaluation methodologies represents a fundamental challenge given the rapid evolution of agentic systems and the inadequacy of static benchmarks. Recent work demonstrates that fixed test sets suffer from contamination, dataset-specific artifacts, and memorization, fundamentally limiting their ability to assess genuine capability ([Muhamed et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10390)). Generative evaluation frameworks that programmatically construct test cases through controlled perturbations offer contamination-resistant alternatives, while LLM-as-a-Judge approaches enable scalable assessment across diverse verification scenarios—though these methods introduce reliability challenges including position bias, overconfidence, and inconsistent scoring that require calibration techniques and ensemble architectures to mitigate ([Li et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15393); [Tian et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06225)). For DPP systems, evaluation must extend beyond task accuracy to encompass critical operational dimensions: abstention behavior when faced with unanswerable questions, particularly crucial given that reasoning-optimized models show degraded selective prediction despite improved correctness ([Kirichenko et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09038)); privacy preservation during multi-agent collaboration, where state-of-the-art systems leak 35-50% of sensitive information even when explicitly instructed otherwise ([Juneja et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15186)); and reliability consistency across architectural variations, enabling systematic comparison of design choices. The emerging "evals literature" emphasizes that evaluation frameworks must be dynamic, multi-dimensional, and adversarially robust—properties essential for regulated supply chain deployments where agent failures carry financial, reputational, and legal consequences ([Gu et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15594)).

### **Standardization and Interoperability Imperatives**

Industry-academia collaboration through standards bodies including GS1 ([GS1, 2024](https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis)), ISO, and CIRPASS should prioritize several critical standardization needs. Unified agent-tool documentation requires resolution of whether Agent Cards specified in the A2A protocol ([Google, 2024](https://developers.google.com/agent-to-agent)) and proposed MCP Server Cards represent complementary standards or overlapping proposals requiring consolidation. Protocol interoperability testing should validate integration of MCP for tool access ([Anthropic, 2024](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture)), A2A for agent communication ([Google, 2024](https://developers.google.com/agent-to-agent)), and emerging frameworks such as XAA for authorization ([Okta, 2025](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2025/09/03/cross-app-access)) and ANS for identity resolution ([Ehtesham et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02279)). Reference implementations and conformance suites would reduce implementation variance and accelerate adoption by providing validated starting points and testing frameworks. Best practices for supply chain-specific deployments should capture lessons from early adopters, avoiding repeated discovery of common pitfalls and enabling knowledge transfer across organizations.

### **Cross-Disciplinary Integration Requirements**

DPP systems fundamentally span multiple disciplines including computer science (agents, protocols, security), operations research (supply chain optimization, sampling strategies), economics (incentive design, platform economics), law (regulatory compliance, liability frameworks), and human-computer interaction (usability, trust). Cross-disciplinary research teams should address: economic modeling of DPP ecosystem dynamics including network effects, platform competition, and data valuation ([Ayob & Hattingh, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-84628-1_12); [Shahidi et al., 2025](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c15309/c15309.pdf); [Hadfield & Koh, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01063)); legal frameworks for liability allocation in multi-stakeholder verification systems where responsibilities span brands, suppliers, and verification service providers ([Kolt, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07913); [Ibrahim et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08544); [Chen et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03255)); and human-computer interaction research for usable, trustworthy DPP interfaces accessible to non-technical users across linguistic and cultural contexts ([Wanitsch et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1145/3706598.3713663); [Eggeling et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1145/3706598.3714001)).

### **Economic Foundations: Transaction Costs and Organizational Restructuring**

The economic case for AI agent-mediated DPP systems extends beyond technical efficiency to fundamental organizational restructuring. Coase's (1937) insight that firm boundaries reflect transaction costs—expenses of search, negotiation, contracting, and monitoring—explains current fashion supply chain hierarchies. AI agents dramatically alter this calculus by reducing coordination costs to near-zero marginal cost ([Shahidi et al., 2025](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c15309/c15309.pdf); [Hadfield & Koh, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01063)). Agents perform exhaustive supplier search without human opportunity cost, conduct parallel negotiations across hundreds of counterparties without fatigue, and maintain continuous compliance monitoring at computational rather than labor cost. Crucially, substantial restructuring occurs even with imperfect agents—the threshold is sufficient capability to lower information gathering barriers below critical coordination costs ([Shahidi et al., 2025](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c15309/c15309.pdf)), not human-level performance.

This transaction cost collapse enables organizational forms previously economically infeasible for DPP implementation. Direct brand-to-Tier-3 verification becomes viable when agents autonomously handle discovery, capability assessment, and contract negotiation. Dynamic supplier networks can reconfigure rapidly as agents renegotiate terms based on real-time performance data, replacing static annual audits with continuous optimization. Micro-specialization emerges—chemical verification specialists, labor auditors, carbon accountants—coordinated by agents without bundling overhead that currently forces vertical integration ([Rothschild et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15799)). Whether this "Coasean singularity" leads to supply chain disintermediation or reconstitution around specialized coordination services remains empirically open, though recent evidence shows AI significantly promotes supply chain diversification by reducing coordination costs ([Yang et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1544612325004738)).

Critical research questions emerge. At what capability threshold do agents enable direct brand-Tier-3 coordination bypassing intermediaries? Minimum efficient scale shifts remain unmeasured, though the organizational transformation potential is substantial. How do agent-negotiated contracts differ in enforcement costs? Do reduced search costs eliminate sustainability attribute price dispersion, or do superior preference-matching capabilities sustain it ([Shahidi et al., 2025](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c15309/c15309.pdf))? Market design challenges emerge from externalities across agent populations ([Rothschild et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15799)).

Regulatory implications follow from liability allocation when agent failures cause harm. The EU's 2024 Product Liability Directive extends liability to digital goods and ongoing updates ([European Union, 2024](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/2853/oj)), but multi-agent DPP systems—where verification emerges from brand, supplier, and platform agent interactions across jurisdictions—raise unresolved causality attribution questions. Privacy tensions intensify as agents require rich preference data for effective negotiation, creating surveillance risks if competitors access aggregated sustainability trade-off data ([Hadfield & Koh, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01063)).

These foundations suggest research priorities: empirical studies measuring transaction cost reductions across supply chain structures; mechanism design for agent-mediated markets with congestion externalities; organizational economics of when agent coordination substitutes for versus complements vertical integration; and law-and-economics analysis of liability rules balancing innovation against harm compensation. The broader "agentic economy" literature ([Rothschild et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15799); [Hadfield & Koh, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01063)) explores how agent-mediated transactions fundamentally reshape market organization—timelines suggesting rapid transformation highly relevant for DPP deployment planning.

Market design challenges specific to DPP platforms include identity verification preventing Sybil attacks where suppliers create multiple fake certifications ([Shahidi et al., 2025](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c15309/c15309.pdf)), platform monetization shifts as agents resist behavioral nudges and advertising-based revenue models, and infrastructure changes like pay-per-verification pricing to prevent agent-driven verification request floods overwhelming certification bodies. Most promisingly, agents enable previously impractical market mechanisms: deferred acceptance algorithms matching brands to suppliers based on comprehensive sustainability preference rankings, privacy-preserving protocols allowing sensitive labor condition inquiries without negative signaling, and preference elicitation where agents discover latent brand values—such as inferring carbon footprint priorities from historical sourcing patterns—to enable sophisticated matching superior to current manual procurement ([Shahidi et al., 2025](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c15309/c15309.pdf)).

### **Beyond MCP**

The accelerating pace of AI development fundamentally challenges any technical review's durability. MCP itself emerged in November 2024 without predecessor protocols in the research literature—no prior work anticipated its specific architecture of standardized tool access for LLM systems. Just four months later, Anthropic introduced Skills (October 2025), lightweight expertise packages that shift architectural emphasis from external tool integration toward embedded capabilities ([Willison, 2025](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/)). This Skills-first pattern—where local operations prefer embedded expertise over MCP server calls—could not have been predicted from MCP's design principles alone. The timeline from MCP launch to architectural pivot illustrates a field where citation half-lives have compressed from years to months: AI preprints now receive first citations in 0.2 years on average, five times faster than 2000-2007 ([Tang et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2020.101094)). Business leaders report that new technologies arrive "at an unprecedented pace, hardly giving businesses time to absorb and adopt one new transformative technology before another comes along" ([Beazley, 2024](https://www.insurancetimes.co.uk/news/technology-obsolescence-is-biggest-digital-threat-in-2024-beazley/1452976.article)), with 27% identifying technology obsolescence as their primary digital threat.

How much of this review will remain relevant in twelve months? Empirical trends suggest substantial portions may require revision. The computation used to train leading AI systems has increased exponentially over the past decade, with acceleration in recent years ([Giattino et al., 2024](https://ourworldindata.org/artificial-intelligence)). Industry leaders including OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic predict AGI arrival within the next few years—ranging from three to five years according to recent public statements ([Axios, 2025](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/20/ai-agi-timeline-promises-openai-anthropic-deepmind))—though such predictions carry high uncertainty. The relevant question for DPP practitioners is not whether this review will become outdated, but which components will obsolesce first. Standards-based integration points—EPCIS events, product identifiers, regulatory compliance requirements—likely demonstrate greater stability than specific protocol choices. The absence of research literature anticipating MCP's emergence, despite years of LLM tool-use research, suggests that the next architectural shift may similarly arrive unheralded. Skills' introduction eleven months post-MCP, fundamentally altering integration patterns, exemplifies precisely this unpredictability. Practitioners should prioritize architectural flexibility and abstraction layers that accommodate protocol evolution over optimization for today's specific implementations.

## **Fashion Future**

## **Cross-Industry DPP Applications Beyond Fashion**

While this review focuses on fashion DPP systems, the challenges and architectural patterns generalize to other sectors regulated under the ESPR framework. The electronics industry faces component traceability challenges including conflict mineral verification and supply chain due diligence requirements ([Conflict Minerals Rule, 2012](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34-67716.pdf)). Right-to-repair documentation, encompassing schematics and replacement part availability information, represents another critical requirement for electronics manufacturers ([Marikyan & Papagiannidis, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-023-05569-9)). Battery passports constitute a particularly urgent case, with the EU Battery Regulation mandating digital product passports for all electric vehicle and industrial batteries exceeding 2 kWh capacity by February 18, 2027 ([EU Battery Regulation, 2023](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023R1542); [Circularise, 2025](https://www.circularise.com/blogs/eu-battery-passport-regulation-requirements)).

The furniture sector confronts distinct sustainability verification challenges. Sustainable forestry certification systems, including Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) traceability requirements, necessitate verification chains from harvested timber through processed furniture products ([FSC, 2025](https://fsc.org/en/chain-of-custody)). Chemical compliance documentation for formaldehyde emissions and volatile organic compound (VOC) content requires laboratory testing results linked to specific product batches ([EPA, 2023](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/02/21/2023-03444/voluntary-consensus-standards-update-formaldehyde-emission-standards-for-composite-wood-products)). Modularity and repair documentation, including disassembly instructions and spare part sourcing information, supports circular economy objectives through extended product lifetimes ([White & Case, 2024](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/eight-key-aspects-know-about-eu-ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation)).

Construction materials present unique challenges due to their scale and permanence. Embodied carbon footprinting across complex material supply chains, from mineral extraction through processing and transportation, requires lifecycle assessment (LCA) methodologies adapted to construction timescales ([Arab et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01466-5); [Greer & Horvath, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110432)). Recyclability and circularity potential documentation must account for decades-long product lifetimes and evolving end-of-life infrastructure. Safety certifications require maintenance of testing documentation throughout product deployment periods potentially exceeding fifty years.

The comparative analysis reveals both commonalities and distinctions across sectors. Sector-specific requirements—such as battery chemistry data versus textile fiber composition—differ substantially in their technical characteristics and verification methodologies. However, generic DPP capabilities including data harmonization, uncertainty quantification, and physical verification exhibit structural similarities across domains. Identifying these commonalities enables shared infrastructure development and cross-sector learning, while sector-specific needs require specialized extensions and domain expertise. Research mapping DPP capability requirements systematically across ESPR-regulated sectors would guide standardization efforts and platform development priorities.

The ESPR working plan for 2025-2030, adopted April 16, 2025, establishes clear priorities among these sectors ([European Commission, 2025](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13682-Ecodesign-for-sustainable-products-working-plan_en)). The plan identifies eleven product groups including textiles (with delegated acts expected in 2027), furniture (adoption timeline targeting 2028), iron and steel, aluminum, tyres, mattresses, and horizontal requirements addressing repairability scoring and recycled content in electronics (anticipated for 2029\) ([Intertek, 2025](https://www.intertek.com/blog/2025/05-28-eu-ecodesign-digital-product-passport/); [One Click LCA, 2025](https://oneclicklca.com/en/resources/articles/first-espr-working-plan)). The prohibition on destroying unsold consumer products takes effect July 19, 2026, initially focused on textiles with anticipated expansion to electronics and other categories pending evaluation ([PicoNext, 2024](https://medium.com/@piconext/ecodesign-for-sustainable-products-regulation-espr-timeline-f4e2e2ba9dbd)).

## **(Research Agenda: Priority Matrix**

**Near-term research priorities for 2025-2027** should address the most critical barriers to production deployment. MCP security hardening and defense mechanism validation require immediate attention given imminent regulatory deadlines ([EU Battery Regulation 2023/1542, 2023](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023R1542)) and current vulnerability profiles ([Zhao et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2025.mcp.taxonomy); [Li et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2025.mcp.privilege); [DarkReading, 2025](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/figma-mcp-server-agentic-ai-compromise)). Production pilots with published performance metrics and documented lessons learned would provide empirical grounding for architectural recommendations. Uncertainty quantification method benchmarking across representative DPP verification tasks would inform method selection for different regulatory requirements ([Angelopoulos & Bates, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07511); [Chen et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02646)). Physical verification cost-benefit analyses informing economic models ([Schiaroli et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jik.2025.100764); [OECD 2019](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/trends-in-trade-in-counterfeit-and-pirated-goods_g2g9f533-en.html)) would guide investment decisions and business model development.

**Medium-term priorities for 2027-2030** should support scaling beyond initial compliance to more sophisticated capabilities. Cross-industry DPP standard harmonization across electronics, furniture, construction, and other ESPR-regulated sectors ([EU Regulation 2024/1781, 2024](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R1781)) would enable shared infrastructure and cross-sector learning. Federated learning approaches for privacy-preserving supply chain collaboration ([Li et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2024.2432469); [Chen et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.07231v1)) would address data sharing reluctance while enabling collective intelligence. Digital twin architectures achieving real-time synchronization at billion-product scales ([Kim et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/machines13020109); [Roman et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/logistics9010022); [Badakhshan & Ivanov, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2025.2507112)) would support advanced monitoring and predictive capabilities. Automated regulatory reporting extracting compliance metrics directly from DPP data would reduce administrative burden and enable continuous compliance monitoring.

**Long-term priorities for 2030 and beyond** envision mature DPP ecosystems delivering transformative transparency. Real-time supply chain intelligence platforms analogous to Bloomberg's role in financial markets would aggregate distributed data, provide standardized analytics, and enable natural language querying across industries ([Wasi et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03692); [Jahin et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10895)). Fully autonomous agent ecosystems with provable safety properties ([Koohestani, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23864); [Ramani et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03469)) would minimize human oversight requirements while maintaining reliability guarantees. Global DPP interoperability enabling seamless cross-border compliance would reduce multi-jurisdictional complexity for international businesses. Circular economy transformation measured through DPP-derived metrics would enable evidence-based policy evaluation and continuous improvement ([Bocken et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1080/21681015.2016.1172124)).

## **Conversational Interfaces and Hyperpersonalization**

Conversational interfaces to DPP data represent an emerging application domain for LLM-powered agents, transforming how stakeholders access and utilize product information. By treating comprehensive DPP datasets as knowledge bases for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, natural language queries such as "What is the most sustainable washing method for this sweater?" or "Can this product be repaired locally?" become technically feasible. However, fundamental research challenges require resolution before such systems achieve production readiness for regulated applications. Hallucination detection and mitigation mechanisms remain critical, with recent advances demonstrating that specialized detectors like LettuceDetect achieve 79% F1 scores while general-purpose models like GPT-4 reach only 63% accuracy on RAG tasks ([Kovács & Recski, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17125)). The technical feasibility of personalization without privacy invasion presents another challenge, with recent comprehensive reviews identifying on-device inference as a promising approach where compact models enable full local processing and eliminate data transmission to cloud servers ([Xu et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00088))—though conversational data represents fundamentally more intimate personal information than search queries ([Tran et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06760)).

Beyond basic question-answering, hyperpersonalization enables several advanced capabilities increasingly demonstrated in conversational commerce contexts ([Aghaei et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10685)). Recent research demonstrates that LLMs produce stereotypical recommendations biased by perceived user demographics—models fail to transparently disclose when suggestions reflect inferred identity rather than stated preferences ([Kantharuban et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05613)). Methods for inferring user personas from interaction patterns through abductive reasoning show promise for tailoring responses without explicitly collecting sensitive data ([Balepur et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11549)), potentially enabling contextual care recommendations that incorporate washing machine type, local water hardness, and climate conditions while preserving privacy. Hybrid multi-agent architectures combining LLM-powered central agents with specialized search components have demonstrated significant latency reductions while maintaining recommendation quality in e-commerce deployments, suggesting technical viability for real-time DPP query responses.

While research on conversational commerce, RAG-powered customer service systems, and AI-based personalization provides relevant foundational techniques, empirical validation specifically in DPP contexts remains limited. The unique requirements of regulated product information—including accuracy guarantees, auditability of information sources, and appropriate uncertainty communication—distinguish DPP conversational interfaces from general-purpose chatbots. Pilot deployments with rigorous evaluation protocols would illuminate both technical feasibility and user acceptance dynamics for these emerging applications, particularly addressing how conversational systems should balance fluency with factual precision in regulatory contexts where inaccurate information carries legal liability.

## **Real-Time Supply Chain Intelligence Platforms**

A long-term vision for mature DPP ecosystems envisions real-time supply chain intelligence platforms analogous to Bloomberg's transformative role in financial markets, aggregating data from distributed sources across supply chain tiers to provide standardized analytics, benchmarking capabilities, and natural language querying across industry-wide datasets. Envisioned capabilities span multiple functional domains: real-time material price and availability data for procurement optimization; supplier performance benchmarking across delivery reliability, quality metrics, and sustainability scores; environmental impact analytics aggregating carbon footprints and resource consumption; disruption monitoring integrating geopolitical risk indicators and climate event forecasting; and regulatory compliance dashboards providing automated ESPR reporting. However, fundamental differences from financial markets complicate platform development. Unlike centralized exchanges with standardized instruments, fashion supply chains exhibit inherent federation across autonomous participants with heterogeneous systems, necessitating competing yet interoperable platforms that avoid monopolistic data control while enabling value-adding services through shared standards like GS1 EPCIS 2.0 ([GS1, 2024](https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis)) and CIRPASS data models ([CIRPASS, 2024](https://cirpassproject.eu/)).

Technical architectures supporting these envisioned Bloomberg-like platforms require substantial innovation beyond current DPP implementations. Digital twin frameworks combining graph modeling with real-time data integration create dynamic representations of supply networks, addressing gaps in current systems that struggle with sudden demand spikes or material shortages ([Wasi et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03692)). Federated learning approaches enable collaborative model training across organizations without raw data exchange, supporting privacy-preserving supply risk prediction and supplier performance forecasting while maintaining regulatory compliance across international boundaries ([Zheng et al., 2025a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07231); [Zheng et al., 2025b](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2024.2432469)). Real-time data utilization proves critical for disruption detection and response, with machine learning models significantly enhancing risk prediction accuracy in post-pandemic contexts characterized by volatile supply conditions ([Jahin et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10895)). These technical capabilities must scale to billions of transactions annually while maintaining low-latency responses suitable for operational decision-making, requiring both algorithmic innovation and substantial infrastructure investment.

Governance and incentive design challenges represent equally critical barriers to realizing supply chain intelligence platforms. Multi-stakeholder governance frameworks must balance transparency imperatives against confidentiality requirements, addressing power differentials across supply chain participants and ensuring equitable access to platform benefits ([Hopkins et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02648)). Network effects must operate within competitive dynamics, incentivizing high-quality data contribution for collective benefit without enabling collusion or cartel formation—a challenge absent from financial markets where regulatory oversight enforces information disclosure. Incentive mechanisms encouraging comprehensive data sharing rather than minimal compliance or strategic withholding require careful design informed by behavioral economics and mechanism design theory. This vision remains aspirational rather than near-term reality, as current DPP implementations focus necessarily on establishing basic compliance infrastructure. However, articulating this long-term trajectory guides incremental development, ensuring that near-term architectural decisions support rather than foreclose future capabilities once foundational challenges of interoperability, data quality, and governance find resolution.

## **Regulatory Evolution and Transition Dynamics**

The DPP regulatory landscape exhibits dynamic evolution with phased implementation timelines creating transition dynamics meriting systematic empirical study. The EU ESPR's phased approach establishes textile DPP delegated acts expected in 2027 with implementation anticipated in 2028, followed by progressively stricter requirements in subsequent phases ([Intertek, 2025](https://www.intertek.com/blog/2025/05-28-eu-ecodesign-digital-product-passport/)). This temporal structure creates strategic tensions for regulated entities between first-mover advantages—including brand differentiation in sustainability-conscious markets, operational learning yielding efficiency gains, and influence over emerging standards—and first-mover risks encompassing higher implementation costs due to immature tooling, limited best practice documentation, and elevated consultant rates during initial market formation. Whether DPP adoption will exhibit procrastination patterns similar to GDPR implementation, where many organizations delayed compliance until approaching regulatory deadlines, potentially creating demand surges for implementation services and verification infrastructure that constrain late adopters' options, remains an open empirical question requiring longitudinal monitoring across industries and firm sizes.

Regulatory fragmentation across jurisdictions represents an escalating challenge as multiple markets develop distinct DPP requirements beyond the EU ESPR framework. Multi-jurisdictional compliance complexity increases substantially with regulatory divergence, raising costs and operational complexity for global fashion businesses navigating differing national frameworks imposing distinct technical specifications and data requirements across regions including North America, Asia-Pacific, and emerging markets ([Chakraborty et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08695)). Research should systematically analyze costs of maintaining separate compliance systems per jurisdiction, feasibility of "DPP portability" where single implementations satisfy multiple regulatory frameworks through common denominators or modular extensions, and political economy dynamics influencing international regulatory coordination versus fragmentation. Enforcement mechanism design significantly influences system requirements and compliance incentives, with regulators facing trade-offs between automated verification through API-based regulatory audits enabling continuous compliance monitoring versus sampling-based physical inspections reducing technical infrastructure demands but potentially enabling superficially compliant "Potemkin DPPs" concealing inadequate underlying data.

Penalty structure design represents a critical policy parameter influencing compliance timing and adoption dynamics. If penalties remain low relative to compliance implementation costs, rational profit-maximizing actors may delay adoption until enforcement actions compel compliance; conversely, if penalties prove high and enforcement demonstrably certain, immediate compliance dominates strategically. Actual penalty structures will emerge as regulations enter force, providing empirical data on enforcement patterns including first violation responses, fine magnitudes, and compliance timeline extensions. The EU AI Act's regulatory sandbox approach, mandating Member States to establish operational sandboxes by August 2026, may offer lessons for DPP implementation though fundamental differences exist—AI sandboxes face challenges including confidentiality concerns, inability to relax legal rules during testing, and innovator reluctance due to lack of conformity presumptions that alternative compliance pathways provide ([Ahern, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05985)). Empirical studies tracking DPP adoption curves across industries, firm sizes, and market positions would inform both policy design—including regulation phasing strategies, enforcement approach selection, and support program targeting—and business strategy encompassing optimal adoption timing, partnership formation, and technology investment decisions, with the coming years presenting a unique natural experiment in regulatory implementation for technology adoption research.

## **Global Standardization and Vocabulary Harmonization**

The proliferation of sector-specific and region-specific DPP initiatives creates urgent need for global harmonization frameworks preventing ecosystem fragmentation. UN/CEFACT's emerging UN Transparency Protocol (UNTP), progressing from initial traceability requirements through blockchain pilots to product circularity data frameworks ([UN/CEFACT, 2024](https://spec-untp-fbb45f.opensource.unicc.org/)), represents the most comprehensive effort toward cross-border DPP interoperability, establishing a "DPP Core data model + sector-specific extensions" approach that balances universal requirements with industry contextualization. UNTP's architectural transition from traditional centralized EDI to web-oriented decentralized governance—leveraging Verifiable Credentials for trust, Linked Data for semantic interoperability, DID-based identity resolution, API-driven data exchange, and security/access control mechanisms—provides a technical foundation enabling federated DPP ecosystems where data custody remains with individual economic operators while discovery and verification occur through distributed protocols ([Pauloski et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05428)). GS1 EPCIS 2.0 compatibility ensures UNTP integration with existing supply chain event logging infrastructure, with Version 1.0 stable release for production implementation due June 2025 ([GS1, 2024](https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis)).

Critical research questions include:

**RQ 1: Vocabulary Standardization Infrastructure** — What governance models, technical architectures, and incentive structures can enable creation and maintenance of comprehensive, globally accessible vocabulary databases covering sector-specific code lists (materials, processes, certifications) and sector-independent data structures? Current vocabulary fragmentation creates substantial data exchange costs through manual re-entry across systems, with over 300 sustainability standards operating with inconsistent terminology. Reference implementations demonstrate viability: ITC Standards Map ([ITC, 2024](https://www.intracen.org/resources/tools/standards-map)) provides the world's largest database for sustainability standards, enabling comparison across 1,650+ criteria covering environmental protection, labor rights, and traceability; Textile Exchange's ASR-213 Materials, Processes, & Products Classification V1.3 ([Textile Exchange, 2024](https://textileexchange.org/knowledge-center/documents/materials-processes-products-classification/)), mandatory for all certificates issued after October 2024, standardizes raw material classification, process categories, and product details across GOTS and Textile Exchange standards. However, scaling to encompass all regulatory and manufacturing standards requires sustainable funding models and multi-stakeholder governance addressing intellectual property concerns, update frequencies, and quality assurance mechanisms. Multi-agent architectures may offer promising coordination mechanisms, with specialized "vocabulary curator" agents maintaining semantic mappings, detecting conflicts between evolving standards, and proposing harmonization resolutions through automated analysis of definitional overlaps and inconsistencies ([Zhang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12508); [Agrawal & Nargund, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02861)).

**RQ 2: Semantic Interoperability for Sustainability Metrics** — How can diverse sustainability measurement methodologies (ISO 14083 transport emissions, EU Product Environmental Footprint, GHG Protocol, etc.) be harmonized to enable meaningful cross-system comparison without requiring universal adoption of a single standard? The World Business Council for Sustainable Development emphasizes that "no need exists for new metrics but for harmonization," proposing alignment of existing metrics within global corporate accountability frameworks ([WBCSD, 2023](https://www.wbcsd.org/)), while GS1 notes that "only a standardised, organised and collaborative use of data will enable a sustainable transition to an authentic circular economy model" ([GS1, 2020](https://gs1.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Circular-Economy-Plan-1.pdf)). The challenge extends beyond data formats to semantic alignment: the same product sustainability metric modeled differently across standards undermines data comparability. Approaches may include: (1) ontology-based semantic mapping enabling automated translation between methodologies; (2) standardized metadata documenting measurement assumptions, boundaries, and limitations; (3) uncertainty quantification frameworks making methodology-dependent variations explicit; or (4) lightweight "core metric" subsets enabling baseline comparison while preserving methodology-specific detail. Agentic systems could implement "translation agents" that convert between measurement frameworks, maintaining provenance chains documenting transformation logic and associated uncertainty propagation ([Qiang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12311)).

**RQ 3: Global-Regulatory DPP Integration Patterns** — What architectural patterns enable seamless data flow between global interoperability-focused DPPs (UN/CEFACT, GS1, industry consortia) and jurisdiction-specific regulatory DPPs (EU battery/textile passports, emerging frameworks in other regions)? UNTP specifically positions itself to provide upstream B2B data feeding high-quality national-level product passports without conflicting with regulatory frameworks, while GS1 EPCIS 2.0 compatibility enables integration with existing supply chain infrastructure ([UN/CEFACT, 2024](https://spec-untp-fbb45f.opensource.unicc.org/); [GS1, 2024](https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis)). However, successful integration requires careful attention to legal boundaries (what data can cross jurisdictional lines?), trust frameworks (how do regulatory authorities verify global DPP data authenticity?), and governance models (who adjudicates conflicts between global and regional requirements?). Multi-agent architectures may offer promising approaches, with specialized "boundary-spanning agents" mediating between global and regulatory domains, translating data formats, enforcing jurisdiction-specific access controls, and maintaining audit trails demonstrating compliance ([Dang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19591); [Zheng et al., 2025a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07231)). The MCP protocol's tool abstraction layer could facilitate these boundary-spanning agents by standardizing interfaces to both global and regulatory DPP systems, though careful attention to security implications (Section 5) remains essential.

**RQ 4: Phased Implementation Strategies** — What deployment pathways balance immediate circular economy value against long-term supply chain transparency goals? The Ellen MacArthur Foundation's Fashion ReModel initiative ([Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2024](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/the-fashion-remodel/overview)), launched May 2024 with leading brands including H&M Group, Zalando, Primark, and Reformation, prioritizes circular business models such as renting, reselling, and repairing—demonstrating industry momentum toward post-sales circular economy applications. Gucci's Denim Project products ([Gucci, 2024](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/transforming-fashion-for-a-nature-positive-impact-gucci)) include digital product passports providing material origins, production journey, and access to care and repair services, illustrating phased DPP deployment focused on consumer-facing circular economy use cases. This phased approach prioritizes recycler/reseller/repairer needs (minimal core data: material composition, chemical standards, sale date) before extending to comprehensive upstream traceability. Research should empirically evaluate whether phased strategies accelerate adoption, examining trade-offs between early wins building political momentum versus comprehensive approaches avoiding costly system rearchitecting as scope expands. Multi-agent systems naturally support phased deployment through modular agent addition ([Han et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04851); [Zhou et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02533)): initial implementations deploy agents serving post-sales use cases, with upstream traceability agents added incrementally as data availability and business requirements mature. Memory architectures (Section 4.2) prove particularly relevant, as systems must retain post-sales transaction history (resale events, repair records, recycling documentation) across extended product lifespans spanning years or decades.

**RQ 5: SME Accessibility and Digital Divide Mitigation** — How can DPP systems remain accessible for SMEs while satisfying increasingly sophisticated regulatory and market requirements? A December 2024 study by Small Business Standards ([SBS, 2024](https://sbs-sme.eu/publication/sbs-study-digital-product-passport-sme-requirements-and-recommendations/)) identifies critical barriers SMEs face implementing DPPs: regulatory overlaps, cost implications, infrastructure deficiencies, and data gaps, with concerns that DPPs will become bureaucratic systems placing disproportionate burdens on small enterprises. OECD research ([OECD, 2024](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/sme-digitalisation-to-manage-shocks-and-transitions_eb4ec9ac-en.html)) confirms that limited access to digital skills and training, combined with lack of time and financial resources to invest in hardware and software solutions, constrains SME digital technology uptake. For Southeast Asian SMEs, barriers include poor internet infrastructure, digital skills gaps, funding constraints, and policy gaps—with problems particularly acute for 80% of Philippine SMEs in rural areas where business owners have limited digital and financial literacy. Research should explore: graduated implementation models with pay-per-use pricing; shared services platforms amortizing infrastructure costs across multiple SMEs; mobile-first interfaces accessible via smartphones prevalent in emerging markets; and AI-powered assistance reducing manual data entry through automated document processing, translation, and validation. The intersection of SME accessibility with multi-agent systems—where lightweight agents provide SME-friendly interfaces to complex backend infrastructure—merits particular investigation ([Hopkins et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02648)). MCP's client-server architecture could enable "SME-facing agents" running on resource-constrained devices (smartphones, tablets) that delegate complex operations to cloud-hosted MCP servers ([Venkatesha et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21594); [Wei et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24045)), though connectivity reliability in regions with intermittent internet access presents challenges requiring offline-capable architectures with eventual consistency guarantees ([Yao et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2024.3407584)).

**RQ 6: Product Lifespan Tracking for Extended Producer Responsibility** — How can DPP systems support actual product lifespan measurement (sale date through end-of-life) rather than proxy metrics like fabric durability? Global Fashion Agenda's February 2025 mapping of global EPR schemes ([Global Fashion Agenda, 2025](https://globalfashionagenda.org/resource/mapping-of-global-extended-producer-responsibility-for-textiles-epr/)) documents proliferation of textile EPR legislation across continents, with the EU mandating separate collection of textile waste from January 1, 2025, California enacting the Responsible Textile Recovery Act in September 2024 as the first US state EPR legislation, and additional schemes operational in the Netherlands (2025) and Latvia (2024). The OECD's December 2024 report on extended producer responsibility in the garments sector ([Brown & Börkey, 2024](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/extended-producer-responsibility-in-the-garments-sector_8ee5adb2-en.html)) confirms that EPR improves separate collection rates while cautioning that EPR alone cannot address all environmental challenges, requiring complementary policies including regulation, economic incentives, and awareness campaigns. Fashion Revolution's 2024 Transparency Index ([Fashion Revolution, 2024](https://www.fashionrevolution.org/wff-2024/)) reveals critical transparency gaps: 86% of companies lack public coal phase-out targets, 94% lack renewable energy targets, and 92% lack renewable electricity targets for supply chains, highlighting the role DPPs could play in enabling verifiable sustainability claims. EPR implementation requires tracking production, sales, and end-of-life textile management to curb fast fashion products with short lifespans that are difficult to reuse or recycle. This approach requires DPP systems to capture and authenticate lifecycle events across organizational boundaries: initial sales, ownership transfers during resale, repair transactions, and eventual recycling/disposal. Blockchain-based approaches have been proposed for immutable event logging ([Qiao et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcra.2024.100266)), yet concerns about costs and environmental impact (Section 2.4) suggest alternative architectures merit exploration. Multi-agent systems with federated event logging—where each lifecycle event is recorded by autonomous agents representing different economic operators (retailers, resale platforms, repair shops, recyclers) with cryptographic signatures ensuring authenticity—could provide transparency without blockchain overhead ([Vaziry et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19550); [Wangelik et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06418)). The memory architecture implications are substantial: systems must maintain product-centric event histories spanning years, requiring long-term memory (Section 4.2) with efficient retrieval mechanisms enabling EPR tax calculations aggregating millions of product lifespans.

# **Conclusion**

Having traversed the landscape of DPP implementation—from regulatory foundations and architectural paradigms through security challenges and physical verification to future research directions—we now synthesize key findings and their implications for stakeholders navigating this transformative yet uncertain technological frontier.

This review has examined Multi-Agent Systems and the Model Context Protocol as architectural paradigms for Digital Product Passport implementation in the fashion industry. The convergence of regulatory mandates embodied in the EU's Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation ([EU Regulation 2024/1781, 2024](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R1781)), technological advances in large language model-based agents ([Wang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13178); [Xi et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07864)), emerging standardization protocols including MCP ([Anthropic, 2024](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture)), and industry readiness demonstrated through initiatives such as CIRPASS-2 pilots ([Fashion United, 2024](https://fashionunited.com/news/business/h-m-zalando-join-eu-digital-product-passport-pilot)) and GS1 adoption ([GS1, 2024](https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis)) creates a critical window for DPP ecosystem development. The regulatory timeline begins with battery passports mandated by February 2027 ([EU Battery Regulation 2023/1542, 2023](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023R1542)), followed by textile sector requirements anticipated for 2030 based on the ESPR working plan ([European Commission, 2025](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13682-Ecodesign-for-sustainable-products-working-plan_en)). This confluence of regulatory pressure, technological capability, and industry mobilization presents both opportunity and urgency for research addressing fundamental gaps in production-ready agentic systems for regulated supply chain applications.

While Multi-Agent Systems leveraging the Model Context Protocol offer conceptually promising solutions to data heterogeneity and interoperability challenges endemic in fragmented global supply chains ([Zhang et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1145/3589334.3645678))—providing standardization benefits through reduced integration complexity, flexibility through heterogeneous tool ecosystems, and scalability through distributed intelligence—our analysis reveals significant production-readiness gaps that constrain near-term enterprise deployment in regulated contexts. Security immaturity represents the most critical gap: comprehensive empirical analysis of 2,562 real-world MCP applications reveals concerning vulnerability patterns with network APIs affecting 56.1% of servers (1,438 instances), system resources impacting 48.3% (1,237 servers), file resources reaching 23.9% (613 servers), and memory resources affecting fewer than 1% (25 servers) though with potentially critical consequences ([Zhao et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2025.mcp.taxonomy); [Li et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2025.mcp.privilege)). The January 2025 disclosure of vulnerabilities in Figma's MCP server enabling arbitrary file access and potential system compromise ([DarkReading, 2025](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/figma-mcp-server-agentic-ai-compromise)) demonstrates that even well-resourced technology companies struggle to implement MCP securely during early protocol maturity stages. Attack success rates under controlled testing conditions prove disturbingly high: direct tool injection achieves 100% success through output manipulation in unvalidated configurations ([Zhao et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2025.mcp.taxonomy)), preference manipulation maintains 75-100% attack success rates depending on sophistication ([Wang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858)), and supply chain attacks demonstrate 16.7-64.7% success rates across different attack vectors ([Guo et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12538)). Deployment complexity represents a second critical gap—successful orchestration of multi-agent systems requires sophisticated coordination mechanisms spanning centralized orchestrator patterns, decentralized mesh topologies, and hierarchical hybrid approaches that lack standardization and validated design patterns for supply chain contexts ([Wang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13178)). Limited empirical validation in production environments with published performance metrics, cost analyses, and failure mode documentation represents a third gap constraining confidence in architectural recommendations.

Beyond security concerns, regulatory compliance in DPP systems demands formal uncertainty quantification mechanisms enabling risk-based human oversight and auditability of agent decisions. Three complementary approaches have emerged from recent research, each offering distinct advantages and limitations. Conformal Prediction provides distribution-free coverage guarantees through calibration sets and nonconformity scores, producing prediction sets guaranteed to contain true values with user-specified probability under exchangeability assumptions ([Angelopoulos & Bates, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07511))—for DPP origin verification, conformal prediction might produce prediction sets such as {Vietnam, Cambodia} with 95% coverage probability. Selective prediction enables models to abstain strategically when uncertain, guaranteeing accuracy on non-abstained predictions at the cost of reduced coverage; information-lift certificates provide provably robust guarantees even under heavy-tailed distributions characteristic of language generation, while selective conformal uncertainty (SConU) uses significance tests to identify samples deviating from expected uncertainty distributions ([Kumar et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15610)). For DPP applications, selective prediction enables tiered workflows: auto-approving high-confidence verifications, requesting additional documentation for medium-uncertainty cases, and escalating low-confidence decisions to human auditors. Interpretable glass-box models including Explainable Boosting Machines (EBM), Neural Additive Models (NAM), and Monotonic Generalized Additive Models with Missing Values (M-GAM) provide inherently interpretable predictions through additive decompositions of feature contributions; M-GAM's principled handling of missing values proves particularly relevant for fashion DPP systems where data incompleteness is endemic ([Chen et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02646)), with typical supply chain transactions providing only 20-30% of potential DPP attributes. No single uncertainty quantification method dominates across all DPP use cases—optimal approaches depend on specific verification tasks, regulatory requirements, data characteristics, and operational constraints, with hybrid methods combining conformal prediction's coverage guarantees with interpretable model explanations representing promising research directions.

Physical verification mechanisms serve as ground truth anchors addressing the inherent limitations of purely digital verification systems (see Section 6 for detailed analysis). Integration of physical authentication technologies spans multiple technical approaches: DNA markers demonstrate 99.9% detection accuracy and survive industrial processing; RFID chips embedded in textiles provide item-level tracking with durability exceeding 200 wash cycles at costs approaching $0.05-$0.10 per unit at scale; portable Raman spectroscopy enables on-site molecular fingerprinting with minutes-to-hours turnaround; and Stable Isotope Ratio Analysis (SIRA) provides geographic origin verification, though requiring specialized laboratory analysis with weeks-long turnaround times. Physical verification can be modeled as Bayesian updates in probabilistic knowledge graphs, where prior beliefs about supplier claims are updated with high-confidence physical verification results ([Nafar et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.15918v1); [Toroghi & Sanner, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v38i18.30040)), with these updates propagating through supply chain graphs to refine beliefs about connected entities. Economic models for verification cost allocation present several alternatives with distinct incentive structures: brand-funded verification suits luxury goods with margins supporting $10-50 verification costs on products exceeding $500 retail prices ([OECD 2019](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/trends-in-trade-in-counterfeit-and-pirated-goods_g2g9f533-en.html)); insurance-linked models require standardization of verification protocols and actuarial models linking verification rigor to risk reduction ([Ghadge et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1108/SCM-10-2018-0357)); VaaS models depend on demand aggregation across multiple brands to achieve viable unit economics; and consumer-driven models require market education and trust in verification claims ([Schiaroli et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jik.2025.100764)), potentially facilitated through gamification strategies ([Arnesson and Westman, 2022](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn%3Anbn%3Ase%3Aumu%3Adiva-197002); [Alves et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.3390/su15065398)).

Critical research priorities for 2025-2027 include MCP security hardening and defense mechanism validation—recent defense mechanisms demonstrate promising effectiveness: MCP-Guard's three-stage detection pipeline achieves 99.54% recall through lightweight static scanning, deep neural detection, and intelligent arbitration, outperforming alternatives while reducing detection latency by 12× ([Xing et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10991)), and MI9's runtime governance framework achieves 99.81% violation detection across 1,033 synthetic agent scenarios through agency-risk indexing and graduated containment mechanisms ([Wang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858)). Additional near-term priorities include production pilots with published performance metrics addressing scalability limits, operational costs, and security posture under realistic threat models; uncertainty quantification method benchmarking across representative DPP verification tasks informing method selection for different regulatory requirements; and physical verification cost-benefit analyses informing economic models and guiding investment decisions. Medium-term priorities for 2027-2030 include cross-industry DPP standard harmonization across electronics, furniture, construction, and other ESPR-regulated sectors ([EU Regulation 2024/1781, 2024](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R1781)) enabling shared infrastructure; federated learning approaches for privacy-preserving supply chain collaboration ([Li et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2024.2432469); [Chen et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.07231v1)) addressing data sharing reluctance; digital twin architectures achieving real-time synchronization at billion-product scales ([Kim et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/machines13020109); [Roman et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/logistics9010022); [Badakhshan & Ivanov, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2025.2507112)); and automated regulatory reporting extracting compliance metrics directly from DPP data. Long-term priorities for 2030 and beyond envision mature DPP ecosystems delivering transformative transparency: Bloomberg-like data aggregation platforms providing standardized supply chain analytics ([Wasi et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03692); [Jahin et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10895)); fully autonomous agent ecosystems with provable safety properties ([Koohestani, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23864); [Ramani et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03469)); global DPP interoperability enabling seamless cross-border compliance; and circular economy transformation measured through DPP-derived metrics ([Bocken et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1080/21681015.2016.1172124)).

The fashion industry's DPP journey serves simultaneously as template and cautionary tale for other sectors, with success requiring coordinated action among multiple stakeholder groups: technologists developing secure, scalable systems architecture and implementation; regulators crafting evidence-informed policies balancing ambitious objectives with practical feasibility; industry participants adopting verification practices and investing in requisite infrastructure; and researchers generating actionable knowledge bridging technical capabilities, business requirements, and regulatory mandates. To our knowledge, this review represents the first comprehensive analysis of MCP applications to fashion DPP systems, synthesizing recent advances in agent architectures, security frameworks, memory management, uncertainty quantification, and physical verification while identifying critical research gaps and outlining a concrete research agenda. The convergence of regulatory pressure, technological capability, and industry mobilization creates an unprecedented opportunity to transform aspirational sustainability commitments into verifiable operational realities, contingent on successful resolution of the fundamental challenges identified in this review.
