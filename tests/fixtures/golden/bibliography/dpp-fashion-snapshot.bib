	abstract = {Over recent years, the rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) has led to the emergence of numerous tools for the creation of visual and textual content. This technological advancement, supported by increasingly robust data management systems and targeted research efforts in this direction, has driven the continuous refinement of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. As a result, Gen AI tools have demonstrated ever-increasing performance, leading to their rapid adoption in various sectors, including the Cultural and Creative Industries (CCI). Here, they are being integrated into value-creation pipelines, potentially impacting both production processes and career prospects for creative professionals.As a consequence, critical questions have emerged about the widespread use of Gen AI, related to the nature of their generative capabilities, often encapsulated under the umbrella term of "computational creativity", which has begun to challenge the traditional conception of creativity as an intrinsic and exclusive capacity of human beings, with implications across all fields in which human creativity is central, such as the design disciplines.In light of the current scenario, the presented research aims to discuss the application of Gen AI tools for image, text, and video generation in fashion design. The analysis draws on the results of a didactic laboratory entitled Artificial A(i)rchive, which involved design practitioners from the Master's degree course in Design for the Fashion System at Politecnico di Milano.Within this workshop, the adoption of Gen AI was investigated, examining how AI was integrated at various stages of the design process and highlighting both the potential and shortcomings of applying Gen AI to support the activities of fashion designers. The article thus aims to contribute to the discussion and identification of collaborative models between fashion designers and AI, while situating the findings within a broader reflection on emerging creative practices and their potential implications.},

	url = {https://doi.org/10.17918/00011002},
	abstract = {This study investigates the effectiveness of machine learning models in automating garment pattern generation, addressing critical challenges in the fashion manufacturing industry. Traditional pattern-making methods, while refined through generations of practice, remain labor-intensive and constrained by human limitations in accommodating diverse body shapes and complex geometries. Through a comprehensive mixed-methods approach, this research develops and evaluates an AI-powered pattern generation system utilizing fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) including ChatGPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5, and Llama 3.1. The methodology employed a two-stage AI pipeline architecture: (1) a vision model for extracting garment features from images and converting them to structured JSON format, and (2) specialized models for transforming JSON specifications into SVG pattern files. Training datasets were systematically constructed using over 10,000 garment patterns from industry partner URBN and the public GarmentCodeData repository. Three distinct fine-tuning approaches were evaluated: specialized training on 150 simple jumpsuit patterns, moderate training on 300 mixed-complexity pants patterns, and comprehensive training on 3,000 diverse garment types. Expert evaluation by professional pattern makers from URBN revealed counterintuitive findings regarding the relationship between training data characteristics and output quality. The specialized jumpsuit model achieved approximately 42\% usability in manufacturing contexts, requiring only minor adjustments for production implementation. Conversely, models trained on larger, more diverse datasets (300 and 3,000 examples) produced patterns deemed unsuitable for real-world manufacturing, despite conventional machine learning expectations that larger datasets improve performance. The research identified an exponential relationship between pattern complexity and training data requirements, with simple patterns amenable to AI automation while complex designs continue to challenge current technological capabilities. Technical limitations included difficulties in capturing nuanced construction details, managing diverse human anatomical variations, and maintaining manufacturing-ready specifications. The vision component demonstrated robust performance in feature extraction, showing predictable scaling with dataset size. Key findings indicate that focused, application-specific AI models outperform general-purpose systems for pattern generation. The study provides empirical evidence that successful AI integration in pattern making requires strategic focus on specific garment categories with consistent construction principles rather than pursuing universal automation. These results suggest that AI should augment rather than replace human expertise, with optimal applications in standardized pattern production where consistency and efficiency are prioritized over creative complexity. This research contributes to understanding AI applications in creative industries by establishing performance benchmarks and identifying optimal training strategies for technical design automation. The findings offer practical guidance for fashion companies considering AI adoption, educators developing curricula that integrate AI literacy, and researchers advancing automated design technologies. Future work should explore hybrid human-AI approaches and specialized models for different garment categories while addressing material property integration and cultural design variations.

	abstract = {Diffusion-based 2D virtual try-on (VTON) techniques have recently demonstrated strong performance, while the development of 3D VTON has largely lagged behind. Despite recent advances in text-guided 3D scene editing, integrating 2D VTON into these pipelines to achieve vivid 3D VTON remains challenging. The reasons are twofold. First, text prompts cannot provide sufficient details in describing clothing. Second, 2D VTON results generated from different viewpoints of the same 3D scene lack coherence and spatial relationships, hence frequently leading to appearance inconsistencies and geometric distortions. To resolve these problems, we introduce an image-prompted 3D VTON method (dubbed GS-VTON) which, by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as the 3D representation, enables the transfer of pre-trained knowledge from 2D VTON models to 3D while improving cross-view consistency. (1) Specifically, we propose a personalized diffusion model that utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning to incorporate personalized information into pre-trained 2D VTON models. To achieve effective LoRA training, we introduce a reference-driven image editing approach that enables the simultaneous editing of multi-view images while ensuring consistency. (2) Furthermore, we propose a persona-aware 3DGS editing framework to facilitate effective editing while maintaining consistent cross-view appearance and high-quality 3D geometry. (3) Additionally, we have established a new 3D VTON benchmark, 3D-VTONBench, which facilitates comprehensive qualitative and quantitative 3D VTON evaluations. Through extensive experiments and comparative analyses with existing methods, the proposed {\textbackslash}OM has demonstrated superior fidelity and advanced editing capabilities, affirming its effectiveness for 3D VTON.},

	abstract = {Generative models have recently achieved remarkable success and widespread adoption in society, yet they often struggle to generate realistic and accurate outputs. This challenge extends beyond language and vision into fields like engineering design, where safety-critical engineering standards and non-negotiable physical laws tightly constrain what outputs are considered acceptable. In this work, we introduce a novel training method to guide a generative model toward constraint-satisfying outputs using `negative data' -- examples of what to avoid. Our negative-data generative model (NDGM) formulation easily outperforms classic models, generating 1/6 as many constraint-violating samples using 1/8 as much data in certain problems. It also consistently outperforms other baselines, achieving a balance between constraint satisfaction and distributional similarity that is unsurpassed by any other model in 12 of the 14 problems tested. This widespread superiority is rigorously demonstrated across numerous synthetic tests and real engineering problems, such as ship hull synthesis with hydrodynamic constraints and vehicle design with impact safety constraints. Our benchmarks showcase both the best-in-class performance of our new NDGM formulation and the overall dominance of NDGMs versus classic generative models.

	abstract = {Traditional 3D garment creation is labor-intensive, involving sketching, modeling, UV mapping, and texturing, which are time-consuming and costly. Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have enabled new possibilities for 3D garment generation from text prompts, images, and videos. However, existing methods either suffer from inconsistencies among multi-view images or require additional processes to separate cloth from the underlying human model. In this paper, we propose GarmentDreamer, a novel method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as guidance to generate wearable, simulation-ready 3D garment meshes from text prompts. In contrast to using multi-view images directly predicted by generative models as guidance, our 3DGS guidance ensures consistent optimization in both garment deformation and texture synthesis. Our method introduces a novel garment augmentation module, guided by normal and RGBA information, and employs implicit Neural Texture Fields (NeTF) combined with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to generate diverse geometric and texture details. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, showcasing the superior performance of GarmentDreamer over state-of-the-art alternatives.

	abstract = {Deep generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Transformers, have shown great promise in a variety of applications, including image and speech synthesis, natural language processing, and drug discovery. However, when applied to engineering design problems, evaluating the performance of these models can be challenging, as traditional statistical metrics based on likelihood may not fully capture the requirements of engineering applications. This paper doubles as a review and practical guide to evaluation metrics for deep generative models (DGMs) in engineering design. We first summarize the well-accepted `classic' evaluation metrics for deep generative models grounded in machine learning theory. Using case studies, we then highlight why these metrics seldom translate well to design problems but see frequent use due to the lack of established alternatives. Next, we curate a set of design-specific metrics which have been proposed across different research communities and can be used for evaluating deep generative models. These metrics focus on unique requirements in design and engineering, such as constraint satisfaction, functional performance, novelty, and conditioning. Throughout our discussion, we apply the metrics to models trained on simple-to-visualize 2-dimensional example problems. Finally, we evaluate four deep generative models on a bicycle frame design problem and structural topology generation problem. In particular, we showcase the use of proposed metrics to quantify performance target achievement, design novelty, and geometric constraints.

	url = {https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/137065},
	abstract = {Changes await the clothing industry as the European Union will soon require clothes to come with a digital product passport. A digital product passport is a system consisting of data, a digital platform, and a data carrier, which requires information about product responsibility, circularity, and legal compliance. The first requirements concerning digital product passports are likely to come into force in 2027. The textile digital product passport is introduced early, as textiles are one of the European Commission's priorities. For the digital product passport, companies will need to collect significant amounts of data about their supply chains and product sustainability. Clothing supply chains are known to be complex, so it is recommended to start preparations as early as possible. This thesis investigated the criteria that can be prepared for before the final requirements of the digital product passport are set. Additionally, the work examined the preparation and challenges of Finnish small and micro-sized clothing companies regarding the implementation of the digital product passport. The research was conducted by studying legislation and literature, as well as interviewing three experts. The experts worked in clothing companies and are involved in implementation process of the digital product passport. The literature revealed that there are several aspects of the digital product passport that companies can already prepare for. Companies can collect likely required data and centralize their data. Companies can also consider suitable data carriers as well as the execution of the digital platform. The research found that the examined companies are well prepared considering the current uncertainty in regulation. The companies have plenty of data from their supply chains. Moreover, two out of three companies would choose QR codes for the data carrier and two out of three would choose service providers to execute the digital platform. QR codes and service providers help implement the digital product passport faster. Companies still need to improve their data centralization, as data was stored on various platforms and not all data was accessible to all employees. One of the challenges identified in the work was the lack of resources. The companies do not have time, money, or employees to dedicate to studying digital product passports. The second challenge was collecting environmental impact data. Digital product passports and their impacts will need to be researched before and after the final implementation, since they will be required for almost all physical products, which results in a significant impact across industries.},

	abstract = {AI agents—autonomous systems that perceive, reason, and act on behalf of human principals—are poised to transform digital markets by dramatically reducing transaction costs. This chapter evaluates the economic implications of this transition, adopting a consumer-oriented view of agents as market participants that can search, negotiate, and transact directly. From the demand side, agent adoption reflects derived demand: users trade off decision quality against effort reduction, with outcomes mediated by agent capability and task context. On the supply side, firms will design, integrate, and monetize agents, with outcomes hinging on whether agents operate within or across platforms. At the market level, agents create efficiency gains from lower search, communication, and contracting costs, but also introduce frictions such as congestion and price obfuscation. By lowering the costs of preference elicitation, contract enforcement, and identity verification, agents expand the feasible set of market designs but also raise novel regulatory challenges. While the net welfare effects remain an empirical question, the rapid onset of AI-mediated transactions presents a unique opportunity for economic research to inform real-world policy and market design.},
